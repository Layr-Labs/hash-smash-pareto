# Orchard Poseidon, r = 1: one centre of the odd-part method on a line, half-gcd with a derived worst case, root isolation (exact ledger, low memory)

## 1. Claim

Target: `poseidon-orchard-r1-prefix-v1` (Orchard P128Pow5T3 over Pallas, full rounds 0-3, one partial round 4, full rounds 60-63,
state `[nk, rho, 2^65]`, digest = coordinate 0). Output: two distinct canonical pairs `(nk, rho)` with equal digests.

* `time_log2 = 25.62074` in target-compression units (`C(1) = 237` primitive operations per unit): the worst-case total of one attempt of the program,
  every executed operation charged (sections 4.2 and 6), no flat allowances for control or dispatch; every data-dependent stage is charged at a bound that is derived in section 6 and that the program checks against its own counters while it runs.
* `memory_log2_bytes = 23.175` (`9,465,382` bytes, section 7), so the normalized cost is `25.62074 + 3.175 = 28.79574`.
* `success_probability = 0.3934`: one attempt, one centre. Section 8 proves a lower bound of 0.3934647661 for one attempt (per-centre bound 0.3934678683, minus the proved cap-6 halt loss 3.1*10^-6, minus the root-isolation failure 2^-36); the claim is below it. The inputs of that proof that are computations are recomputed by the verifier of section 10 from the organizer constants (section 8.7).
* The method (two free rounds on a special line, so that the digest is a univariate polynomial of degree `5^7`, then the roots of its odd part about a centre) is a known approach. What is offered here is a complete finite implementation with an exact operation ledger, a low-memory schedule,
  a half-gcd whose worst-case charge is derived, and a root isolation with a proved failure bound. Nothing here is an asymptotic estimate: every figure below is the count of an executed, instrumented program whose complete source is reproduced in section 10.
* The collisions stored in `certificates/` (2 pairs, each from a separate attempt of this program) are outputs of this program. They check the construction at the
  selected target with the organizer's hash; the cost and probability claims do not use them.

## 2. Two free rounds: a line in the input plane

Notation. `p = 0x40000000000000000000000000000000224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001`, `p mod 5 = 2`, so `gcd(5, p-1) = 1` and `x -> x^5` is a
bijection of `F_p` with inverse `x -> x^e`, `e = (4(p-1)+1)/5` (254 bits). `M` is the deployed 3x3 MDS, `c_{i,k}` the
deployed round constant `k` of round `i` (read from the organizer constants; never regenerated).

2.1 Round 0. With `U = (nk + c_{0,0})^5`, `V = (rho + c_{0,1})^5`, `K = (2^65 + c_{0,2})^5` the state after round 0 is `M (U, V, K)^T`.
`(nk, rho) -> (U, V)` is a bijection of `[0,p)^2` (inverse `nk = U^e - c_{0,0}`, `rho = V^e - c_{0,1}`), so every `(U, V)` has exactly one canonical preimage. `K` is a constant.

2.2 Round 1. The S-box input is `x_k = M_{k0} U + M_{k1} V + b_k`, `b_k = M_{k2} K + c_{1,k}`, affine in `(U, V)`.
The program uses the line `j = 0`. With `I = {i1, i2} = {0,1,2} \ {j}`, let `Q = (U_Q, V_Q)` be the solution of `x_{i1} = x_{i2} = 0` (the 2x2 determinant
`M_{i1,0} M_{i2,1} - M_{i1,1} M_{i2,0}` is a minor of the MDS, nonzero on the deployed constants, checked). Let
`(a, b) = (M_{j,1}, -M_{j,0})` and `(U, V) = Q + tau (a, b)`. Then `x_j = kappa` is constant and `x_i = d_i tau` for `i in I`, where
`d_i = M_{i0} a + M_{i1} b` (`d_j = 0`). With `W = tau^5` the round-1 S-box output is `v0 + W v1`, `v0 = kappa^5 e_j`, `v1 = sum_{i in I} d_i^5 e_i`
(the supports are disjoint). After the round-1 MDS and the round-2 constants the state is `alpha + beta W` with `alpha = M v0 + c_2`, `beta = M v1`, affine in `W`.

2.3 Digest polynomial. Rounds 2, 3 (full), 4 (partial, r = 1), 60, 61, 62, 63 (full) put seven S-box layers on top of an affine map, and the digest
is row 0 of the last MDS. So the digest equals `F(W)` with `deg F <= 5^7 = D = 78125`. The leading coefficient is obtained by
propagating leading coefficients through the seven layers (a partial round contributes only coordinate 0 at the top degree); on the deployed constants it is nonzero for the line used:
`f_D(0) = 0x1c66a426cd2d5ec686ea41cae3a27d49c8724fffa0bc4f305029be8b2cce93c3`
(computed; so `deg F = D` exactly). For random `tau`, `F(tau^5)` equals the reference hash of the canonical inputs built from `tau` (checked on 5 random `tau`
against an independent big-integer reference that reproduces the 11 public Orchard vectors).

2.4 Collision criterion. If `W1 != W2` and `F(W1) = F(W2)` then `tau1 != tau2` (`x -> x^5` is injective), hence `(U, V)` differ (`(a, b) != 0`),
hence the canonical pairs `(nk, rho)` differ, and the digests are equal. Every `W in F_p` is `tau^5` for exactly one `tau`.

## 3. Odd part with a centre

For a centre `c in F_p` write `F(c + s) - F(c - s) = 2 s g_c(s^2)`. Because `D = 2m + 1` with `m = 39062`, `g_c` has degree exactly `m` and
leading coefficient `2 f_D(0)` (independent of `c`, nonzero), so `g_c` can be made monic. A collision pair with midpoint `c` is exactly `W1 = c + s`,
`W2 = c - s` with `s != 0` in `F_p`, i.e. `S = s^2` a nonzero square with `g_c(S) = 0`. The roots that are useful are the roots in `F_p` with
`S^((p-1)/2) = 1`: they are the roots of `G = gcd(g_c, S^((p-1)/2) - 1)` (roots that are nonsquares give `s` outside `F_p` and are of no use; `S = 0` gives `s = 0` and is not a root of `S^((p-1)/2) - 1`).
`G` divides `S^((p-1)/2) - 1`, which is squarefree, so `G` is a product of `deg G` distinct linear factors over `F_p`.

Construction of `g_c` by evaluation. `H = 49152 = 3 * 2^14` divides `p - 1` (`p - 1 = 2^32 * 3 * q`), and `H >= m + 1`. Let `omega` be a primitive `H`-th root of unity
and `zeta` with `zeta^2 = omega`. Then `g_c(omega^i) = (F(c + zeta^i) - F(c - zeta^i)) / (2 zeta^i)`, `i = 0..H-1`. One inverse transform of size `H` returns the
coefficients of `g_c` (the `H - m - 1` high coefficients are zero because `deg g_c = m < H`; interpolation is exact). The `2H = 98304` evaluations of `F` are each charged as
one target-compression unit (`C(1) = 237` operations), although a line evaluation (affine start, six more rounds, one row of the last MDS) is a strict subset of the work of a full reference permutation.
The extra work of the loop (two additions for the points, one subtraction, one multiplication by `1/(2 zeta^i)`, two multiplications for the recurrences `zeta^{i+1}`, `zeta^{-i-1}`, one store with its address operation,
the loop control, and the executed shifts, masks, ors, modulo operations and loop control of the bit-reversed index `layout_index`, which are counted inside that function) is charged on top.

## 4. The program (one attempt)

```
init:   twiddle table
setup:  the line (line_setup)
A  c := uniform 254-bit word (one random word + 2 control ops)
B  g := monic g_c, by section 3 (98304 evaluations + one inverse NTT of size 49152 + normalisation by the leading coefficient)
C  R := S^((p-1)/2) mod g           (left-to-right square-and-multiply on the exponent, base S; 238 modular squarings, 45 of the steps also multiply by S by a streaming shift)
D  G := gcd(g, R - 1) (monic)       (half-gcd with NTT products, section 4.4);   if deg G = 0 the attempt fails (no root)
E  S := a root of G                 (root isolation, section 4.1)
F  s := sqrt(S) (Tonelli-Shanks, 2-adicity 32); W1 = c + s, W2 = c - s; tau_i = W_i^e; (U,V)_i = Q + tau_i (a,b); nk_i = U_i^e - c_{0,0}, rho_i = V_i^e - c_{0,1}
G  verify: the two reference hashes (237 operations each) are equal and the pairs differ -> output
```
The exponent `(p-1)/2` has bit length 254 and Hamming weight 46. Binary powering therefore performs 253 modular squarings and 45 multiplications by `S`; the 15 bits after the leading one are zero, so the program starts from the monomial `S^v` with `v = 2^15 < m` (this absorbs 15 of the 253 squarings, 15 + 238 = 253), and the squaring loop of stage C has 238 steps, of which 45 also multiply by `S` (a streaming shift).
The ledger below counts what the program executes; no figure in this document assumes another weight.

Halts. The program is compiled with `-DDEG_CAP=6`. It ends early in exactly three ways that can happen with positive probability: stage D finds `deg G = 0` (the attempt has no useful root; a failure event of section 8), stage D finds `deg G > 6` (the cap, charged 2 operations; a failure event of section 8, bounded there) and a level of the root isolation has no proper split after its `t(d)` tries (probability at most `2^-36` over all levels, section 4.1).
Every other test that ends the program (a charged gcd or division exceeds its derived bound, a division leaves a remainder, the leading coefficient of `g_c` is zero) cannot fire: the first two are comparisons against bounds that are derived in section 6 as a calculation (kernel charges at the maximal operand lengths, maximum number of nodes, levels and tries),
the last is a fixed property of the constants and was checked. There is one attempt, no loop over attempts, and no budget check whose failure could stop a later stage.

### 4.1 Root isolation (stage E)

Input: monic `G`, degree `d >= 1`, a product of `d` distinct linear factors over `F_p`. Output: a root.
`d = 1`: the root is `-G_0`. `d = 2`: the root is `(s - G_1) / 2` with `s = sqrt(G_1^2 - 4 G_0)` (Tonelli-Shanks; the discriminant is a square since both roots are in `F_p`).
`d >= 3`: repeat for at most `t(d)` tries, `t(d) = ceil(40 / (d - 1))` for `d <= 40` and `t(d) = 1` for `d > 40`:
draw `c` uniform in `[0, 2^254)`; replace `G(Z)` by `G(Z - c)` (Taylor shift; the roots become `r + c`); `S := Z^((p-1)/2) mod G`; `A := gcd(G, S - 1)` (monic; classical Euclid for `d <= 152`, the half-gcd of section 4.4 above).
`A` is the product of the factors whose root `r + c` is a nonzero square. If `1 <= deg A <= d - 1` the try is proper: continue with `A` if `deg A <= d - deg A`, otherwise with `G / A` (exact division, section 4.5); in both cases the new degree is at most `floor(d/2)`.
If no try of a level is proper, the attempt fails (halt). At the end the root of the final linear or quadratic factor is shifted back by the sum of the `c` used.
The roots of the final polynomial are roots of `G`: each piece divides the previous one.

**Lemma B.** Let `G` be a monic product of `d >= 3` distinct linear factors over `F_p`, `d <= 2^17`, and `c` uniform in `[0, 2^254)`. The probability that `deg gcd(G(Z - c), Z^((p-1)/2) - 1) in {0, d}` is at most `2^(1-d) + 2^-100`.
Proof. Let `r_1..r_d` be the roots, `chi` the quadratic character (`chi(0) = 0`), `E = {-r_i}`. The degree of the gcd is `#{i : chi(r_i + c) = 1}`. For `c not in E`,
`[chi(r_i + c) = 1 for all i] = prod_i (1 + chi(r_i + c))/2 = 2^-d sum_{S} chi(prod_{i in S} (r_i + c))` and `[chi(r_i + c) = -1 for all i] = 2^-d sum_S (-1)^|S| chi(prod_{i in S} (r_i + c))`.
For `S` nonempty, `prod_{i in S}(Z + r_i)` is squarefree of degree `|S|`, so by Weil's bound `|sum_{c in F_p} chi(prod_{i in S}(c + r_i))| <= (|S| - 1) sqrt(p)` (the sum is 0 for `|S| = 1`). Summing over `c not in E` costs at most `d` more per term.
So the number of `c in F_p` with all `chi = 1`, and likewise with all `chi = -1`, is at most `p/2^d + (d-1) sqrt(p) + d`, and the `c in E` add at most `d`. Dividing by `2^254 >= p (1 - 2^-128)` (the draw is uniform on a subset of `F_p`, so counts of bad values over `F_p` bound the counts over the subset):
probability `<= 2^(1-d) (1 + 2^-127) + 2 (d-1) 2^-127 + 3d 2^-254 <= 2^(1-d) + 2^-100`. QED.

**Failure bound of stage E (stated once).** Let `eps(d) = (2^(1-d) + 2^-100)^t(d)` be the failure probability of a level of degree `d`. For `d > 40`, `t = 1` and `2^(1-d) <= 2^-40`, so `eps(d) <= 2^-40 (1 + 2^-60)`.
For `3 <= d <= 40`, `t(d) (d - 1) >= 40` gives `eps(d) <= 2^-40 (1 + 2^-60)^t`. In all cases `eps(d) < 2^-39.99`. The degree at least halves at every level, and `deg G <= m = 39062`, so the levels have degrees at most
6, 3 (2 levels with `d >= 3`, because the cap gives `deg G <= 6`); the ledger charges the larger schedule 9, 4. Hence the failure probability of stage E, whatever `G` is, is at most `2 * 2^-39.99 < 2^-38`.
The event `c = 0` (the Taylor shift needs `1/c`) has probability `2^-254` per try; over the at most 19 tries of the charged schedule (`t(9) + t(4) = 5 + 14`) it adds below `2^-246`, and it is included in the same bound (`2 * 2^-39.99 + 2^-246 < 2^-36`). The number of tries of a run is at most the sum of `t(d)` over the levels (for the worst schedule 19 tries).

### 4.2 Machine model and charging rules

Every item below is counted by the executing code at the statement that executes it; none is estimated. The complete source is in section 10.
* canonical `F_p` addition, subtraction, negation (one subtraction), doubling (one addition), multiplication and squaring: 1 each; inversion and exponentiation are expanded (`a^(p-2)`: 254 squarings and 76 multiplications, 330 operations; `x^e`; `x^((p-1)/2)` on a single element: counted exactly).
* load or store of a 256-bit element of an array: 1 each, and each such access is charged together with one address-formation operation (one control operation): `LD(n)` adds `n` to the load counter and `n` to the control counter, `ST(n)` likewise.
* every loop that is not unrolled: `3n + 2` control operations for `n` iterations (the index update, the bound comparison and the conditional branch of each iteration, and one comparison and branch when the loop is left); `loopc(n)` adds exactly this after such a loop of `n` iterations. Loops that are unrolled (macro `FOR8` in `common.h`: the pointwise, copy, fold and subtraction loops of the powering and of the products) execute their body 8 times per pass without any branch inside the body; the macro itself adds 1 operation for the bound `n & ~7`, 3 operations at the end of every pass of 8 (index update, comparison, branch), 2 when the main loop is left, and then runs the remaining 0 to 7 elements in a plain loop (3 per iteration, 2 on exit). The loads and stores of the body are charged inside the body, per element.
* every other executed index or control operation, one each: shift, mask, or, addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulo, comparison, conditional branch, and the selection of an element of the 16-word register block by a computed index. They are added with `CTL(k)` next to the statement that executes them, and data-dependent tests are charged per executed test.
* transform kernels are generated, straight-line code (`gen_kern.py` is part of the source of section 10; its output `ntt_kern.h` and `ntt_a3.h` are listed there). A block kernel for `k` layers (1 to 4; 2^k data words `x[]`) has no loop and no branch: each butterfly is the literal statements `fp_sub`, `fp_add`, `fp_mul` (three field operations, none for the multiplication when the twiddle is 1 at `b = 0`), and every twiddle load is a literal statement carrying its own charge on the same line: the first twiddle of a layer `tw + (b << sjs[j])`: shift and addition (2 operations), the load and its address formation (`LD(1)`); every further twiddle of the layer: one addition of the stride `D[j]` and `LD(1)`. In the inverse kernel the first twiddle address `tw + ((nh - (b << sj[j])) << sh)` costs 4 operations. The kernel for `b = 0` is a second generated variant that omits the twiddle of `tp = 0` (it is 1) and its multiplication. A pass function (`pf1..4`, `pi1..4`, `pu1..4_sq/_mul` in `ntt_kern.h`) contains the group loop and the block loop around the kernel: group base address (1), block base address (1), 3 operations per loop iteration and 2 on loop exit as written in the generated code, the loads and stores of the 2^k words of the block each with `LD(1)` / `ST(1)` (one address formation each); the block `b = 0` of a group is peeled so that no per-block test of `b` is executed. The wrapper (`pass_fwd`, `pass_inv`, `pass_fused`) charges the computation of the pass constants (a loop over the layers) and the `switch` on `k` (and on the mode) once per pass.
* working registers (disclosed assumption): a block keeps its 2^k <= 16 data words `x[]` in registers; the twiddle operand and the butterfly temporary need two further words, so the kernels assume a register file of 18 words of 256 bits. Strides, shift counts, base pointers and loop indices are held in integer registers (not charged as memory accesses). The 256-bit constants of the radix-3 kernels (`W3[1]`, `W3[2]`, `CH`, `DL`) are not assumed to be in registers: every use is charged as one load (`LD(1)` in the generated statement). The real cost of a machine with fewer registers would be higher; this is the one structural assumption of the model.
* a random word: 1 plus 2 control operations for a 254-bit word (`rnd_fp254`).
* the bit loops of inversion and exponentiation executed outside stages with a per-operation rule: 2,310 control operations per inversion.
* small-degree work in the line setup, the schoolbook `Z^((p-1)/2)` for `d <= 40` and the verification is charged generously: on top of every arithmetic operation 2 loads, 1 store and 6 control operations.
* the reduced permutation evaluations of stage B: 237 each (section 3), instead of their (smaller) expanded arithmetic. Nothing else is charged as a unit.
* dispatch and selection: the source contains `switch` statements (on `k` and on the mode, once per pass) and three tables of function pointers (`RGF`, `RGI`, `RGR`: the region driver of the radix-3 stage chosen by the pattern of nonzero inputs and the class of `c0`, once per region); each is charged by `CTL` next to the statement (4 operations for a table lookup and indirect call, 4 for the `switch` on `k`). Every other selection (`if`, `?:`, `while` tests, the test of the mode in `pass_fused`, the tests of `P->rows`, the choice of the operand pointer in `conv_core`, the validity tests, the choice between the schoolbook and the fast division, the tests of the recursion in `hgcd`) is charged by a `CTL` next to the statement, as the comments show.
* radix-3 stage (generated in `ntt_a3.h`): the positions `i0` of a row are processed by straight-line position kernels, one per (pattern of nonzero inputs, rotation): `LD(1)` per nonzero input, the field operations of the selected linear map written out (each multiplication by a constant preceded by the `LD(1)` of the constant), `ST(1)` per output. A region driver runs the kernels of the three phases of `i0 mod 3` over a range of positions: head (positions until the phase is 0), a loop of three positions per iteration (`i += 3`, comparison, branch: 4 operations per iteration), tail; every test of the head, loop bound and tail is charged next to its statement. The ranges of constant pattern are computed by `split_regions` (breakpoints, insertion sort, patterns), each of whose operations is charged next to its statement; one call costs a few hundred operations.
* every executed statement of the stages (`poly_gcd_own`, `hgcd`, `divrem_fast`, `gcd_cl`, `taylor_shift`, `split_find_root`) is charged where it is written, including the compare, branch and subtraction of every loop test, as the comments of section 10 show.
Not charged (declared): conversion of constants to the internal Montgomery representation (constants of the program text and the conversion of a loop counter into a field element in `taylor_shift`, once per use), the bookkeeping of the allocator (`xalloc`, `xfree`: memory is accounted in section 7), formatting and printing.

### 4.3 Stage C: the powering schedule (in place, no stored spectra)

For the exponent `E` (here `(p-1)/2`), `m` the degree of the modulus, `N = 3 * 2^a >= 2m - 1` and `N' = 3 * 2^b >= m + 1`. A transform of size `3 * 2^a` is a twiddle-free radix-3 stage (Good-Thomas; each radix-3 leaf costs 8 operations) followed by three independent
rows of radix-2 transforms of length `2^a`, run as passes of at most four layers (blocks of at most 16 words in registers, see section 4.2). The state is `s = a / N` so no scaling is needed in the loop.
One step maps the residue `a` (`m` coefficients, stored in the buffer `Y` of `N` elements) to `a^2 mod g`:
```
Y := conv_sq(Y)                       square: forward transform, pointwise square fused with the first inverse pass, inverse transform
F[i] := Y[i] + Y[i+N'] (i < m)       fold of the low part modulo x^N' - 1 (saved in the buffer F of m elements)
Y[0..m-2] := Y[m..2m-2]               high part T1 of the square
Y := conv(Y, MU)                      quotient q (Barrett): MU = x^(N-m+2) * floor(x^(2m-2)/g) / (N N') stored compactly (m-1 elements)
Y := conv_N'(Y, g)                    (q * g) mod (x^N' - 1)
Y[i] := F[i] - Y[i] (i < m)           new residue; if the exponent bit is 1: shift by x and subtract lead * g (streaming)
```
The spectra of `MU` and of `g` are not stored: for each multiplication the second operand is transformed one row of the Good-Thomas layout at a time into a buffer `tmp`, immediately multiplied into the corresponding row of `Y`, and discarded.
`MU` is computed once from `g` by Newton iteration with the same row-wise products. The leading exponent bits are absorbed by starting from the monomial `S^v` with `v < m`.
All charges of this stage depend only on `m` and the exponent, not on the coefficients.

### 4.4 Stage D: the half-gcd

Notation: a polynomial is stored as its coefficient array with the top coefficient nonzero (length = degree + 1). Euclid sequence of `(a, b)`, `deg a > deg b`: `r_0 = a`, `r_1 = b`, `r_{i-1} = q_i r_i + r_{i+1}`; `d_j = deg q_1 + ... + deg q_j`, so `deg r_j = deg a - d_j`;
`R_j = Q_1 ... Q_j` with `Q_i = [[q_i, 1], [1, 0]]` (entries of degree at most `d_j`; the first-row entries of degree exactly `d_j` for `r11`), and `(r_0, r_1)^T = R_j (r_j, r_{j+1})^T`.

`hgcd(a, b, k)` (`deg a = n`) returns, for `h = max{ j : d_j <= k }`, the matrix `R_h` (when asked) and the pair `(r_h, r_{h+1})`. The code: if `b = 0` or `n - deg b > k` return the identity. If `k <= 48`, plain Euclid (`poly_divrem_naive`) while the next quotient degree fits the remaining parameter.
Otherwise, `k1 = ceil(k/2)` (`k1 = floor(n/2)` if `2 k1 > n`), `s = n - 2 k1`: (1) `R1 = hgcd(a quo x^s, b quo x^s, k1)` (the top parts, matrix wanted); (2) `(c, d) = R1^{-1} (a, b)` by NTT products (`apply_inv`); (3) if `d = 0` or the next quotient degree `deg c - deg d` exceeds `k - d_1`
(`d_1 = deg R1`) return `R1` and `(c, d)`; (4) divide `c = q d + e` (`divrem_any`); (5) `R2, (c', d') = hgcd(d, e, k - d_1 - deg q)`; return `R1 Q R2` (matrix products by NTT, only if the matrix is wanted).
The outer function `poly_gcd_own` repeats, while `deg b > 0` and `n = deg a > 96`: `(c, d) = hgcd(a, b, floor((n+1)/2))`, one division `c = q d + e` and `(a, b) := (d, e)`; below 96 it runs classical Euclid; at the end it scales the last nonzero remainder to be monic (one inversion, `deg + 1` multiplications).

**Fact 1 (truncation).** Let `a = a* x^s + a0`, `b = b* x^s + b0`, `deg a0, deg b0 < s`, `deg a* = 2 k1 > deg b*`, and let `h` be such that `d*_h <= k1` for the Euclid sequence of `(a*, b*)` (starred quantities). Then the first `h` quotients of `(a, b)` equal those of `(a*, b*)`, and
`(r_h, r_{h+1}) = (x^s r*_h + e_h, x^s r*_{h+1} + e_{h+1})` with `deg e_h, deg e_{h+1} < s + d_h`.
Proof. The entries of `R_i^{-1}` are polynomials of degree at most `d_i`, so `(r_i, r_{i+1}) = R_i^{-1}(a, b) = x^s R_i^{-1}(a*, b*) + R_i^{-1}(a0, b0)` has errors `e_i, e_{i+1}` of degree `< s + d_i`. Induction on `i < h`: with `q*` the next quotient of the top parts,
`r_i - q* r_{i+1} = x^s r*_{i+2} + (e_i - q* e_{i+1})`, where `deg (x^s r*_{i+2}) < s + deg r*_{i+1}` and `deg (e_i - q* e_{i+1}) <= s + d_i + deg q* - 1 = s + d_{i+1} - 1 < s + deg r*_{i+1}`, because `deg r*_{i+1} = 2 k1 - d*_{i+1} >= k1 >= d_{i+1}`.
So the remainder of `r_i` by `r_{i+1}` has degree below `deg r_{i+1} = s + deg r*_{i+1}`: `q*` is the true quotient. QED.

**Fact 2 (progress of the second call).** In a node with parameter `k > 48` for which step (4) is executed, `d_1 + deg q >= k1 + 1` (`d_1 = deg R1`). Consequently the parameter of the second call is `k' = k - d_1 - deg q <= k - k1 - 1` and the first polynomial `d` of the second call has degree at most `n - k1 - 1`.
Proof. If `R1` is the identity, the first quotient of the top parts has degree `> k1` and equals `deg a* - deg b* = n - deg b` (the true first quotient degree), so `deg q > k1`, `d_1 = 0`, and `deg d = deg b < n - k1`. Otherwise, with `h >= 1` the number of quotients of `R1`, maximality of `h` gives `d*_{h+1} > k1`, so `deg r*_{h+1} = 2 k1 - d*_{h+1} <= k1 - 1`;
by Fact 1 `deg r_{h+1} <= max(s + k1 - 1, s + d_h - 1) = s + k1 - 1`, while `deg r_h = n - d_h = s + 2 k1 - d_h`. Hence `deg q = deg r_h - deg r_{h+1} >= k1 + 1 - d_h`, and `deg d = deg r_{h+1} <= s + k1 - 1 = n - k1 - 1`. QED.

**Fact 3 (outer loop).** After `hgcd(a, b, k)` with `k = floor((n+1)/2)`, `deg d < n - k`, so the next outer degree is at most `floor(n/2) - 1`.

**Division.** `divrem_any(a, b)`, `la - lb + 1` quotient coefficients `kq`: if `kq <= 64` or `lb <= 64` schoolbook (`poly_divrem_naive`); otherwise (`divrem_fast`) the reversed Newton identity: `q_rev = (a_rev * inv(b_rev mod x^kq)) mod x^kq`, `q = reverse(q_rev)`, `r = a - q b` (low `lb - 1` coefficients), with
the reciprocal by Newton iteration `g_{2t} = g_t - x^t (g_t * mid(f g_t))` and all products by `poly_mul`.

### 4.5 Exact division in stage E

When `deg A > d/2`, `G / A` is computed with `divrem_any(G, A)`; the remainder is checked to be zero (it is, as `A | G`).

## 5. Why the output is a collision

By sections 2-3: a root `S` of `G` is a nonzero square root of `g_c`, `s = sqrt(S) != 0`, `F(c+s) = F(c-s)`, `c+s != c-s`, so the canonical pairs of section 2 differ and collide. Stage G recomputes both reference hashes
and compares them; the output is only emitted if they are equal and the pairs differ. Independent of the program, the pairs in `certificates/` are checked by the organizer's hash.

## 6. Ledger (primitive operations; `C(1) = 237`)

The counts of the data-independent stages are the exact totals of the instrumented execution (`arith` = additions, subtractions, multiplications, squarings; `other` = loads, stores, control, random words, and the 237-operation unit charges).
The stages whose cost depends on the data are charged at derived bounds, which are not observations:

* **Stage D (gcd), `deg g = m = 39062`, `deg (R - 1) <= m - 1`.** The bound `B_gcd(d)` is the evaluation of the following recursion (program `gcdbound`, section 10), in which every kernel is charged at the cost of the executed kernel on operands of the maximal length.
  `B_hgcd(n, k)` for `k <= 48`: at most `k` division steps with `sum (deg q_i + 1) <= 2k`, each at the schoolbook bound `div_cost_bound` at length `n + 1`, plus `k` matrix updates at the maximum over the splits `d_1 + deg q <= k`.
  For `k > 48`: `B_hgcd(2 k1, k1)` (first call) `+ max(K_apply(n+1, k1), copy) + B_div(n, min(k,n) + 1) + B_hgcd(n - k1 - 1, k - k1 - 1)` (second call, Fact 2) `+ K_mulQ + K_matmul` (matrix wanted) `+ 28 (n + 1) + 200`.
  `B_gcd(n) = sum over the outer iterations m_0 = n, m_{i+1} = floor(m_i / 2) [ B_hgcd(m_i, floor((m_i + 1)/2)) + B_div(m_i, m_i + 1) ] + classical end + monic scaling`.
  `K_apply(l, K)`, `K_matmul`, `K_mulQ` and `K_divfast` are the charges of the executed kernels (`apply_inv`, `mat_mul`, `mat_mulQ`, `divrem_fast`) on operands whose coefficients are all nonzero, of the maximal lengths (for `apply_inv` the output length is fixed to `l = la`, so its charge depends on `la` and `K` only);
  the data-dependent scans (`trimlen`, 10 per entry) and the search of the 64-entry cache in `plan_invN` (at most 448 per call) are added at their worst case. Every charge of a kernel is a nondecreasing function of its operand lengths (all its loops run over the lengths and its plan is the smallest `3 * 2^a` covering the output length), so the charge at the maximal lengths bounds every execution.
  The value for `(39062, 39061)` is 3,336,226,048 operations; the run of this ledger charged 1,508,601,747 (ratio 0.452). The program asserts `charged <= bound` for the main gcd and for every gcd of the root isolation (exit status 81 otherwise); the table of bounds (`gcd_bounds.h`, section 10) is generated by `gcdbound H`.
  Tests: the gcd was compared with classical Euclid on planted gcds with normal and abnormal remainder sequences (`test_hgcd`, section 10).
* **Stage E (root isolation), worst case.** The levels of section 4.1 start at degree at most 9 (the cap gives `deg G <= 6`; 9 is charged, which is larger) and halve. For each level of degree `d` and each of its `t(d)` tries the charge is `shift(d) + pow(d) + gcd bound(d) + div bound(d)` plus the random word and control (about 60 operations),
  where `shift(d)` (the Taylor shift) and `pow(d)` (`Z^((p-1)/2) mod G`) are measured at that exact degree on random input (their cost does not depend on the coefficients), `gcd bound(d)` is `gcd_cost_bound(d, d-1)` (closed form, derived in section 10 `split.c`) for `d <= 152` and the table value above,
  and `div bound(d)` is the maximum over `a` in `(d/2, d)` of `div_cost_bound(d + 1, a + 1)` for `d <= 152` (schoolbook) and `B_div(d, d/2 + 1)` above (the division of `G` by `A` happens only when `deg A > d/2`; asserted at every division).
  The last level (`d = 2`) costs 16,000 operations (one square root with its control charge, one inversion). Every measured value and every table value is multiplied by 1.02 (the table lists the measured values for shift and pow; the factor 1.02 is applied in its last column and is already applied in the gcd and division columns).

| stage | arith | other | total | data-dependent |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| init: twiddle table (once) | 17,359 | 126,642 | 144,001 | no |

Worst case of the root isolation (stage E) over the level schedule of section 4.1 (starting degree 39062):

| d | tries t(d) | shift(d) | pow(d) | gcd bound | div bound | t(d) x (1.02 (shift + pow) + gcd + div + 100) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 9 | 5 | 7,093 | 694,997 | 52,248 | 3,161 | 3,858,205 |

| quadratic end (d = 2) and level control | | | | | | 16,100 |
| total | 19 | | | | | 6,254,613 |

Worst case of one attempt (stage D finds the largest possible `G`, stage E runs to the end at the worst degrees):
`init + setup + A + B + C + D bound + scan + E bound + final allowance = 144,001 + 3,910 + 3 + 32,709,831 + 8,851,927,313 + 3,336,226,048 + 390,630 + 6,254,613 + 400,000 = 12,228,056,351` operations `= 51,595,174.5` units, `time_log2 = 25.62073`, claimed as `25.62074` (rounded up).
(A run in which stage D finds no root stops after about 10,393,386,817 operations; a run in which `G` is linear charges about 10,393,434,884, as in the logs of this ledger.)
Composition by type of the ledger run (init included; the control counter includes the address operations of loads and stores): add `1,368,825,116`, sub `1,279,204,609`, mul `1,246,451,982`, sqr `33,326,305`, loads `1,626,342,731`, stores `841,035,553`, control `3,974,950,539`, unit charges `23,298,048`.

Stage C in detail (m = 39062): Newton for MU: 56,854,971 operations; prefix and scaling: 508,491; 238 squaring steps at 36,951,626 operations each (arith 14,769,136). Of the arithmetic of stage C, 3,536,772,927 operations; the transforms are the largest term.

### 6.1 Ledger recomputation

```python
from math import log2, ceil
C = 237
init, setup, rand, build, power = 144001, 3910, 3, 32709831, 8851927313
gcd_bound, scan, split, final = 3336226048, 390630, 6254613, 400000
N = init + setup + rand + build + power + gcd_bound + scan + split + final
print('N =', format(N, ','), ' units =', round(N / C, 1), ' time_log2 =', '%.5f' % (ceil(log2(N / C) * 100000 - 1e-6) / 100000))
```

## 7. Memory

Peak of live data of the executing program, tracked by the allocator that serves every buffer (each buffer is one allocation). Stage C at `m = 39062`: the twiddle table (`2^14` elements, 524,288 bytes), `Y` (`3 * 2^15` elements, 3,145,728), `tmp` (`2^15` elements, 1,048,576), `MU` (1,249,952),
`g` (1,250,016) and the result `F` (1,249,984). Tracked peaks of the ledger run per stage: init (twiddle table) 524,288; line setup 524,288; random centre 524,288; B 3,347,168; C 8,468,544; D 9,103,968; E 524,416; F 524,288; G 524,288. For the worst-case root isolation the stages at the degrees of the level schedule were run by the calibration program: Taylor shift 525,536, powering 525,472 bytes (including the live arrays), the gcd stage of the top level (the half-gcd of degrees 39062 and 39061 is stage D of the ledger run itself, whose tracked peak is in the list above; no gcd of that size occurs in the root isolation under the cap, so `test_keep` is not used) not applicable under the cap;
the largest is 9,103,968 bytes. To the heap peak we add the static image of the executable (code, constants and tables: text 284,734 + data 1,712 + bss 5,336 = 291,782 bytes), a stack bound of 65,536 bytes (the complete run was executed under a 64 KiB stack limit) and 4,096 bytes for the allocator's own metadata:
`9,465,382` bytes `= 2^23.175`. The memory penalty is `max(0, 23.175 - 20) = 3.175`.
Not counted, as they are not part of the abstract program: the dynamic C library and loader mappings and kernel structures of the host process.
The program has no stored advice and no precomputed data beyond what it computes itself (the twiddle table is built at run time and charged in stage "init").

## 8. Success probability

**Statement.** One attempt of the program of section 4 (DEG_CAP = 6, one uniform centre `c`, uniform shifts in stage E) outputs a digest collision with probability at least **0.3934647661**. The claimed value `0.3934` is below it.
The random experiment: the program draws the centre `c` (one uniform 254-bit word) and the shifts of stage E; all are independent and uniform (the cost model has independent uniform random words as a primitive; the executed program uses a 64-bit xorshift generator, and the claim uses the idealisation, D18 below).
The attempt succeeds iff `1 <= N(c) <= 6` and stage E isolates a root, where `N(c)` is the number of nonzero squares `S` in `F_p` with `g_c(S) = 0` (stage D then returns `G` with `deg G = N(c)`).

**The chain, in one place.**
1. Per centre: for `c` uniform in `F_p`, `P(N(c) >= 1) >= 0.3934678683` (sec. 8.2: Bonferroni sums for `k <= 6`, point counts on the `k`-tuple curves by Hasse-Weil, genus bound by Riemann-Hurwitz). This uses the hypothesis `HK(k)`, `k <= 6`: the `k`-tuple curves are geometrically irreducible.
2. `HK(k)`, `k <= 6`, follows from CERT A (the full sign module, sec. 8.5.3) and CERT B (the block action contains `A_d`, sec. 8.5.5), through the `(d-2)`-transitivity of `A_d` (Lemma 8.5.6).
3. CERT A is computed at the critical point `c_A` of the line (sec. 8.5.3). CERT B is proved from the witness of sec. 8.6 (centre `c0`, prime factor degree `l = 20269`), together with transitivity of the block action (Lemma 8.5.1), which needs absolute irreducibility of `Q = (F(u) - F(v))/(u - v)`, which comes from indecomposability of `F` (witnesses for the six inner degrees, sec. 8.5.1; the team holds 18 for the three lines) and the cited classification theorems.
4. The cap: centres with `deg G >= 7` are abandoned. `P(N(c) >= 7) <= E[C(N,6)]/7 <= 3.102141*10^-6` is PROVED from the same chain (sec. 8.3): no loss term is assumed.
5. Root isolation fails with probability at most `2^-36` (section 4.1), whatever `G` is.
6. Total: `0.39346786834977 - 3.102141*10^-6 - 1.4552*10^-11 >= 0.3934647661` (sec. 8.4.2).

**What is proved here, what is computed, what is cited, what is idealised.** Everything labelled PROVED is proved in this document from the items labelled COMPUTED and CITED below. COMPUTED items are exact computations over `F_p`; the verifier of sec. 8.7 (source in section 10) recomputes every one of them from the organizer constants and the two numbers `c0`, `l`. CITED items are theorems of the literature, with the status of our check of each stated in sec. 8.8. The only idealisation is D18 (ideal randomness), which `claim.json` also states. No sample and no heuristic about the roots of `g_c` enters section 8. The heuristics H1 and H2 declared in `claim.json` concern the charges of section 4.2 and the worst-case ledger and are stated at the end of this section; they do not enter the probability.

Numbers of the form `sec. 8.a.b`, `Lemma 8.a.b`, `Proposition 8.a.b`, `Theorem 8.a.b` and the labels `D1`...`D19` refer to this section 8.

### 8.1 Setup, structure, and the genus bound

#### 8.1.1 Notation

p = 0x40000000000000000000000000000000224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001 (D1). F in F_p[W] is the line polynomial of the r = 1 construction for the line j used by the program, with deg F = n = 5^7 = 78125 and leading coefficient a_n != 0 (D2). Put D = n - 1 = 78124 and d = D/2 = 39062. Since p != 5, p does not divide n. Since p > n and p > N_6 (sec. 8.1.4), all ramification indices below are tame.

P(c,s) := (F(c+s) - F(c-s))/s in F_p[c,s]. h(c,S) in F_p[c,S] is defined by P(c,s) = h(c,s^2) (Lemma 8.1.1). g_c := h(c,*). N(c) := #{S in F_p : h(c,S) = 0 and S = s^2 for some s in F_p^*}. Delta(c) := disc_s P(c,*) in F_p[c], and Delta_S(c) := disc_S h(c,*). K denotes an algebraic closure of F_p.

#### 8.1.2 Structure and collisions

**Lemma 8.1.1 (structure). PROVED.** (a) P is even in s, so h exists and is unique, deg_S h = d, and the S^d-coefficient of h is 2a_n. (b) P has total degree D; writing P = Sigma_j a_j(c) s^j, one has deg_c a_j <= D - j and a_D = 2a_n. (c) P(c,0) = 2F'(c), so deg_c h(c,0) = D.

*Proof.* (a) F(c+s) - F(c-s) is odd in s, hence divisible by s, and the quotient is even. Since n is odd, the coefficient of s^n in (c+s)^n - (c-s)^n is 1 - (-1)^n = 2, so the s^D-coefficient of P is 2a_n. (b) The total degree of F(c+s) - F(c-s) is at most n, with degree-n part a_n((c+s)^n - (c-s)^n); division by s lowers the total degree by one. (c) F(c+s) - F(c-s) = 2 Sigma_{j odd} F^{(j)}(c) s^j / j! (valid since p > n), whose s^1-term is 2F'(c)s. [end]

**Lemma 8.1.2 (collisions). PROVED.** For c in F_p, the map {u,v} -> S = ((u-v)/2)^2 is a bijection from the unordered pairs {u,v} subset of F_p with u != v, F(u) = F(v) and u + v = 2c onto {S in F_p^{*2} : h(c,S) = 0}. Hence N(c) equals the number of such collision pairs, and N(c) >= 1 iff F has a collision with midpoint c.

*Proof.* For such {u,v} set s = (u-v)/2 in F_p^* (p odd). Then P(c,s) = (F(u)-F(v))/s = 0, so h(c,s^2) = 0. Swapping u and v replaces s by -s and leaves S unchanged, so the map is well defined. S determines {s,-s}, hence the pair {c+s, c-s} = {u,v}: injective. Conversely, if S = s^2 with s in F_p^* and h(c,S) = 0, then P(c,s) = 0, so F(c+s) = F(c-s) with c+s != c-s, and this pair maps to S.

**Lemma 8.1.3 (top form). PROVED.** Let P_D(1,lambda) = a_n((1+lambda)^n - (1-lambda)^n)/lambda. Then P_D(1,*) = 2a_n prod _{zeta in mu_n minus {1}} (lambda - (zeta-1)/(zeta+1)), a polynomial of degree D with D distinct roots. It is even in lambda.

*Proof.* Since p does not divide n, mu_n has n elements in K. P_D(1,0) = 2n a_n != 0, so every root lambda is nonzero, and (1+lambda)^n = (1-lambda)^n gives zeta := (1+lambda)/(1-lambda) with zeta^n = 1, zeta != 1. The Mobius map zeta -> (zeta-1)/(zeta+1) is injective on mu_n minus {1} (-1 not in mu_n since n is odd) and inverts the correspondence. So the D roots are exactly these, and they are distinct. Evenness: (1+lambda)^n - (1-lambda)^n is odd in lambda. [end]

**Lemma 8.1.4 (discriminant degree). PROVED.** Delta(c) != 0 and deg_c Delta = D(D-1) =: B.

*Proof.* Put t = 1/c and Phat(t,u) := t^D P(1/t, u/t) = Sigma_{a+b <= D} p_{ab} t^{D-a-b} u^b in F_p[t,u], where P = Sigma p_{ab} c^a s^b. Then Phat(0,u) = P_D(1,u) and the u^D-coefficient is 2a_n. The roots of Phat(t,*) are u_i = t s_i, so disc_u Phat(t,*) = t^{D(D-1)} Delta(1/t) (the leading coefficients agree). By Lemma 8.1.3, disc_u Phat(0,*) != 0. Hence Delta(c) = c^{D(D-1)} E(1/c) with E(t) := disc_u Phat(t,*) a polynomial with E(0) != 0, so deg_c Delta = D(D-1) exactly. [end]

**Lemma 8.1.5 (S-discriminant). PROVED.** Delta(c) = kappa * h(c,0) * Delta_S(c)^2 for some kappa in F_p^*. Consequently deg_c Delta_S = D(D-2)/2 = 2d(d-1). In particular Delta_S != 0, and the finite branch points of the splitting cover of h(c,*) are among the zeros of Delta_S, at most 2d(d-1) of them.

*Proof.* The roots of P(c,*) are +-s_i, where S_i = s_i^2 are the roots of h(c,*). Pairs inside one block give (2s_i)^2 = 4S_i. For i < j the four cross pairs give (s_i-s_j)^2(s_i+s_j)^2(s_i+s_j)^2(s_i-s_j)^2 = (S_i-S_j)^4. So Delta = (2a_n)^{2D-2} prod _i 4S_i prod _{i<j}(S_i-S_j)^4 = kappa' prod _i S_i * Delta_S^2. Since prod _i S_i = +-h(c,0)/(2a_n), the identity follows. Degrees: 2 deg Delta_S = deg Delta - deg h(c,0) = D(D-1) - D by Lemmas 1.4 and 1.1(c). [end]

**Lemma 8.1.6 (k-fold algebra; no ramification at infinity). PROVED.** Let A_1 := K[c][s]/(P(c,s)) and A_k := A_1 (x)_{K[c]} ... (x)_{K[c]} A_1 (k factors) = K[c][s_1..s_k]/(P(c,s_i)). Then:
(a) A_1 and A_k are free over K[c] of ranks D and D^k, and deg_c disc(A_k/K[c]) = k(D-1)D^k.
(b) Let t = 1/c. The K[[t]]-algebra A^infinity_k := K[[t]][u_1..u_k]/(Phat(t,u_i)) is finite etale over K[[t]] and is the integral closure of K[[t]] in A_k (x) K((t)). Consequently every point over c = infinity of the normalisation of any component of Spec A_k has ramification index 1.

*Proof.* (a) A_1 has basis 1, ..., s^{D-1} since the leading coefficient is a unit, and disc(A_1) = Delta up to a unit. For free algebras of finite rank, disc(A (x) B) = disc(A)^{rk B} disc(B)^{rk A}; by induction disc(A_k) = Delta^{k D^{k-1}} up to a unit, of degree kD^{k-1} * D(D-1) = k(D-1)D^k. (b) The discriminant of A^infinity_k at t = 0 is the discriminant of Phat(0,*) = P_D(1,*) (Lemma 8.1.3), which is nonzero, so A^infinity_k is etale; etale over a DVR implies normal, and A^infinity_k (x) K((t)) = A_k (x) K((t)) via s_i = u_i/t. A factor of A_k (x) K((t)) therefore has integral closure a direct factor of A^infinity_k, which is etale. [end]

#### 8.1.4 Genus bound, fibres, and point count

Notation for k >= 1: N_k := prod _{j<k}(D-2j); A'_k := 2 - 2N_k + k(D-1)D^k; B := D(D-1); pi_k := 1/(2^k k!); err'_k := (A'_k sqrt p + N_k(B+1) + 1)/(2^k k! p). Let X_k(c) be the set of ordered k-tuples of roots of P(c,*) with pairwise distinct squares and nonzero entries; |X_k(c)| = N_k for c outside a finite set. Let Z_k^o := {(c,s_1..s_k) : P(c,s_i) = 0, s_i != 0, s_i^2 != s_j^2} over U := K minus Sigma, where Sigma := {zeros of Delta} union {infinity}, so |Sigma intersect P^1(F_p)| <= B+1.

**HK(k).** Z_k^o is geometrically irreducible. Equivalently, the geometric monodromy G of P(c,*) acts transitively on X_k(c). (Z_k^o -> U is finite etale with generic fibre X_k(c), and its connected components correspond to G-orbits on that fibre.)

**Proposition 8.1.7 (genus bound). PROVED given HK(k).** Let Ztilde be the smooth projective model of the closure of Z_k^o, with genus g. Then Ztilde -> P^1 has degree N_k and 2g <= A'_k.

*Proof.* The degree is N_k, which is below p, so the cover is tame and Riemann-Hurwitz gives 2g - 2 = -2N_k + Sigma_Q (e_Q - 1). Points over c = infinity contribute nothing (Lemma 8.1.6(b)). For a finite c_0, tameness gives Sigma_{Q over c_0}(e_Q - 1) = ord_{c_0} disc(Atilde_0), where Atilde_0 is the integral closure of K[c] in the function field of the component. Since A_k (x) K(c) is etale (Delta != 0), its integral closure Atilde is a product of the integral closures of its factor fields and disc(A_k) = disc(Atilde) * [Atilde : A_k]^2, so deg disc(Atilde_0) <= deg disc(A_k) = k(D-1)D^k (Lemma 8.1.6(a)). Therefore 2g <= 2 - 2N_k + k(D-1)D^k = A'_k. [end] (For k = 1, A'_1 = (D-1)(D-2), the plane-curve bound.)

**Lemma 8.1.8 (fibres). PROVED given HK(k).** For c in U the fibre of Ztilde over c is X_k(c). The fibres over c in Sigma have at most N_k points. Hence |#Z_k^o(F_p) - #Ztilde(F_p)| <= N_k(B+1).

*Proof.* Over U the algebra A_k is etale, so Ztilde -> P^1 is etale over U and the fibres have N_k points. Over U, a root is never zero (a root at 0 would have even multiplicity, forcing Delta(c) = 0), so the only possible coincidences are s_i = +-s_j, and the coincidence locus is clopen in Spec A_k|_U (it is the preimage of the diagonal of an etale cover). Z_0|_U is irreducible and open-closed in Spec A_k|_U, so the coincidence locus is either empty or all of Z_0|_U. It is not all of Z_0|_U, since the generic fibre is X_k. Hence the fibre is X_k(c). Over c in Sigma intersect P^1(F_p), both fibres lie in [0, N_k]. The point infinity contributes at most N_k. There are at most B+1 points of Sigma intersect P^1(F_p). [end]

**Proposition 8.1.9 (point count). PROVED given HK(k).** |#Z_k^o(F_p) - p| <= A'_k sqrt p + N_k(B+1) + 1.

*Proof.* Ztilde is defined over F_p and geometrically irreducible of genus g <= A'_k/2 (Proposition 8.1.7). Hasse-Weil gives |#Ztilde(F_p) - (p+1)| <= 2g sqrt p <= A'_k sqrt p. Combine with Lemma 8.1.8 and the "+1". [end]

#### 8.1.5 The one-centre procedure (the program of section 4)

Input: c in F_p.
1. Compute h(c,*) in F_p[S]. This uses the grid of section 3: with H = 49152 = 3*2^14 (H | p-1 and H >= m+1 for m = d), let omega be a primitive H-th root of unity and zeta^2 = omega. Evaluate g_c(omega^i) = (F(c+zeta^i) - F(c-zeta^i))/(2zeta^i) for i = 0..H-1 (2H = 98304 evaluations of F), and recover the coefficients of h(c,*) by one inverse transform of size H (exact, since deg h = d < H).
2. Compute G := gcd(h(c,*), S^{(p-1)/2} - 1). Since x^{(p-1)/2} - 1 is squarefree with roots the nonzero squares, G is squarefree and its roots are exactly the distinct nonzero-square roots of h(c,*). So deg G = N(c). If deg G = 0, output "no collision".
3. Find one root S of G (randomised root isolation of section 4.1; failure event RI).
4. s := sqrt S (Tonelli-Shanks; the 2-adic valuation of p-1 is 32). Output (c+s, c-s) after checking F(c+s) = F(c-s) by direct evaluation.

By Lemma 8.1.2, step 4 outputs a collision whenever N(c) >= 1 and step 3 succeeds. The check in step 4 is deterministic. The capped variant (section 4, DEG_CAP = 6) outputs "no collision" when deg G > 6.

### 8.2 Per-centre probability: P(N(c) >= 1) >= 0.39346786834977

**Statement.** For c uniform in F_p, P(N(c) >= 1) >= 0.39346786834977, hence >= 0.3934678683. The only assumption is HK(k <= 6). Its derivation is in sec. 8.5.

**Proof.** The chain below is stated with every constant explicit. It uses Proposition 8.1.7, Lemma 8.1.8 and Proposition 8.1.9 (the genus bound, fibre comparison and point count), with k-tuple curves Z_k^o as in sec. 8.1.4 and the notation there (N_k, A'_k, B, pi_k, err'_k).

```text
(3) FINAL INEQUALITY CHAIN (every constant explicit)
  Step 1 (pointwise). For integers y >= 0:  1_{y>=1} - sum_{k=1}^{6} (-1)^{k+1} C(y,k) = C(y-1,6) >= 0 for y >= 1,
      and the left side is 0 for y = 0.  Hence, averaging over c in F_p,
      X >= sum_{k=1}^{6} (-1)^{k+1} m_k,   m_k := (1/p) sum_{c in F_p} C(N(c), k).
  Step 2 (counting). Each rational S gives two values s = +-sqrt(S) in F_p^*, and each ordered tuple of distinct S gives
      2^k times the ordered tuples of s. Hence
      m_k = #Z_k^o(F_p) / (2^k k! p).
  Step 3 (Weil on the normalization). Let Ztilde be the smooth projective model of the closure of Z_k^o. It is defined over
      F_p and geometrically irreducible, of genus g_k, with 2g_k <= A'_k. Hasse-Weil gives
      |#Ztilde(F_p) - (p+1)| <= 2 g_k sqrt(p).
      Let Sigma = {zeros of disc(P) in K-bar} u {infinity}, so |Sigma| <= B+1. For c not in Sigma, the fibres of Z_k^o and
      Ztilde agree (both are the N_k-point set X_k(c)). For c in Sigma, each fibre has 0..N_k points. Hence
      |#Z_k^o(F_p) - #Ztilde(F_p)| <= N_k (B+1).
      Therefore |#Z_k^o(F_p) - p| <= A'_k sqrt(p) + N_k(B+1) + 1.
  Step 4 (combine). |m_k - pi_k| <= err'_k := (A'_k sqrt(p) + N_k(B+1) + 1)/(2^k k! p), and since
      sum_{k=1}^{6} (-1)^{k+1} pi_k = 18131/46080,
      X >= 18131/46080 - sum_{k=1}^{6} err'_k.

```
**Status.** PROVED given HK(k <= 6). HK(k <= 6) is derived in sec. 8.5 from CERT A (D7, computed and recomputed by the verifier of sec. 8.7) and CERT B (D13, the witness of sec. 8.6).

### 8.3 The loss from the cap (centres with deg G >= 7 are abandoned)

**8.3.1 The k = 6 factorial-moment bound, explicitly.** Let m_6 := E_c[C(N(c),6)] = (1/p) Sigma_{c in F_p} C(N(c),6). By the counting identity (Step 2 of sec. 8.2), m_6 = #Z_6^o(F_p)/(2^6 * 6! * p) = #Z_6^o(F_p)/(46080 p). Under HK(6), Proposition 8.1.9 gives #Z_6^o(F_p) <= p + A'_6 sqrt p + N_6(B+1) + 1. Therefore

E[C(N,6)] <= 1/46080 + err'_6 = 1/46080 + (A'_6 sqrt p + N_6(B+1) + 1)/(46080 * p).

For n = 5^7 the constants are:

- N_6 = prod _{j<6}(D-2j) = 227268920464644506156921963520
- A'_6 = 2 - 2N_6 + 6(D-1)D^6 = 106570042361223701138346902470760450
- B + 1 = 6103281253
- sqrt p = 1.70141183460469231732 * 10^38
- err'_6 = 1.3592934328 * 10^-8 (COMPUTED; the Weil term A'_6 sqrt p/(46080 p) is all of err'_6 up to a relative 10^-30)

So

**E[C(N,6)] <= 1/46080 + 1.3592934328*10^-8 = 2.1714981824*10^-5** (rounded up from 2.17149818232*10^-5).

The leading term 1/46080 = 2.1701388889*10^-5 is the group-model value of the moment. The bound is conservative by the Weil term.

**8.3.2 Abandonment.** For integers N >= 0 and c >= 5: if N >= c+1 then C(N,6) >= C(c+1,6), since C(*,6) is nondecreasing on integers >= 6. Hence 1[N >= c+1] <= C(N,6)/C(c+1,6), and taking expectations,

P(N >= c+1) <= E[C(N,6)] / C(c+1,6).

- Cap c = 6 (the cap of this entry): C(7,6) = 7, so P(N >= 7) <= 2.1714981824*10^-5 / 7 <= **3.102141*10^-6**.

The program abandons exactly on {N(c) > c}, because deg G = N(c) (sec. 8.1.5, step 2).

Consequently P(N(c) >= 7) <= 3.102141*10^-6 is a PROVED bound (given HK(6)), computed from the same Weil-bound chain as sec. 8.2 and not from any sample.
Arithmetic re-done for this document (60-digit decimal arithmetic): E[C(N,6)] <= 2.17149818232164e-5, divided by 7 gives 3.10214026045949e-6, which is below the stated 3.102141e-6.

### 8.4 From a digest collision to the success probability

**8.4.1 From a digest collision to a collision of F (Lemma 8.4.1). PROVED given D17.** The line data are fixed by the constants and do not depend on c or tau: Q = (U_Q, V_Q) and (a, b) = (M_{j,1}, -M_{j,0}) are the affine solution and direction of the line of section 2.2, and U = U_Q + tau*a, V = V_Q + tau*b are the state variables built from tau. The line index j is the one used by the program. Let e := 5^{-1} mod (p-1), which exists since gcd(5, p-1) = 1. Let W_1 != W_2 in F_p with F(W_1) = F(W_2), and put tau_i := W_i^e. Then tau_1 != tau_2, the canonical pairs (nk_i, rho_i) built from tau_i are distinct, and their digests are equal.

*Proof.* x -> x^5 is injective on F_p, so tau_1 != tau_2 and tau_i^5 = W_i. The pairs (U_i, V_i) = Q + tau_i(a,b) are distinct since (a,b) != 0. The map (nk, rho) -> (U, V) is a bijection of [0,p)^2 (section 2.1), so the canonical pairs are distinct. By D17 the digest of the pair built from tau_i equals F(tau_i^5) = F(W_i), which is the same for i = 1, 2. [end]

**D17 (digest identity).** For the line j, the digest of the canonical input built from tau equals F(tau^5). Reason: after the round-1 affine step the state is affine in W = tau^5, and each of the seven S-box layers multiplies the degree in W by 5, so the digest is a polynomial in W of degree <= 5^7. F is that polynomial; it is determined by its values at 131072 > 5^7 points (COMPUTED), The verifier of sec. 8.7 (step V1) builds F from the organizer constants by exactly this interpolation and checks F(tau^5) against an independent straight-line reference hash at 5 random tau.

**8.4.2 Theorem (success). PROVED given HK(6) and the other items of the dependency list.** One attempt of the program of section 4 with DEG_CAP = 6 outputs a digest collision with probability at least

0.39346786834977 - P(N >= 7) - 2^-36 >= 0.3934678683 - E[C(N,6)]/7 - 2^-36 >= **0.3934647661**.

*Proof.* The procedure outputs a collision whenever 1 <= N(c) <= 6 and root isolation succeeds (sec. 8.1.5). So P(success) >= P(1 <= N <= 6) - P(1 <= N <= 6 and RI fails) >= P(N >= 1) - P(N >= 7) - 2^-36, by sec. 8.2, sec. 8.3 and the failure bound of stage E in section 4.1 (at most 2^-36, whatever G is; the shifts of stage E are independent of c). A collision of F gives a digest collision by Lemma 8.4.1. [end]

Values (arithmetic re-done in 60-digit decimal arithmetic): 0.39346786834977 - 0.00000310214026 - 0.0000000000145519 = 0.39346476619496 >= 0.3934647661. The claimed value 0.3934 is below it by 6.5*10^-5.

**Randomness (D18).** The program draws c as a uniform 254-bit word, which lies in [0, 2^254) subset of F_p, and the total-variation distance from uniform on F_p is 2^-128.9. The statement assumes ideal randomness (independent uniform random words, the model primitive of the cost rules). The executed program uses xorshift, which is an idealisation that we state and do not prove. This is the one premise of section 8 that is not a computation or a cited theorem.

### 8.5 HK(k) from CERT A and CERT B

**8.5.0 Overview.** HK(k) follows from CERT A (the full sign module) and CERT B (the block action contains A_d) by Lemma 8.5.6. CERT B uses transitivity of the block action (Lemma 8.5.1), which uses absolute irreducibility of Q, which uses 2-transitivity of Mon(F) (sec. 8.5.1).

**8.5.1 Absolute irreducibility of Q.** Let G_F := the geometric monodromy group of F(X) - t over K(t). The components of Q(u,v) = 0 over K correspond to the G_F-orbits on ordered pairs of distinct roots. So Q is absolutely irreducible iff G_F is 2-transitive (cited: Fried). **PROVED (cited).**

G_F is 2-transitive when G_F in {A_n, S_n}. That follows from:
- (i) F is geometrically indecomposable (D12). Let F = G(H') over the algebraic closure K with deg H' = m, so m divides n and m is one of 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625 (m < n). Replacing H' by (H' - H'(0))/lc(H') and G accordingly, H' is monic with H'(0) = 0. With r = n/m the terms of F other than g_r H'^r have degree <= n - m, so the coefficients of x^(n-i), 0 <= i < m, of F and of g_r H'^r agree. This fixes g_r = a_n and fixes H' = x^m + b_1 x^(m-1) + ... + b_(m-1) x + b_m as follows: the series 1 + b_1 y + ... + b_(m-1) y^(m-1) is the r-th root, with constant term 1, of A(y) = sum_(i<m) (a_(n-i)/a_n) y^i modulo y^m (the root is unique because p does not divide r, as p != 5), and b_m = H'(0) = 0. So H' = H_m, the polynomial computed in step V7 of sec. 8.7, and its coefficients lie in F_p. If F = G(H_m) then the remainder F mod H_m, computed in F_p[x], would be the constant G(0). COMPUTED (V7): for each of the six values of m, F mod H_m has degree m - 1 > 0. So F is indecomposable over K, and no descent theorem is needed. (The six H_m of line 0 were also produced by the team's separate code and match by SHA-256; the team holds the same test for lines 1 and 2, 18 witnesses in all, which this entry does not use.)
- (ii) Primitivity of G_F (cited: from indecomposability, by Luroth, for a polynomial with p not dividing n) and an n-cycle in G_F (the monodromy at infinity is an n-cycle, since p does not divide n).
- (iii) The classification of primitive groups containing an n-cycle (Feit 1980, Mueller 1995, as restated in Jones, arXiv:1209.5169, Thm 1.2; purely group theoretic): such a G_F contains A_n unless (a) n is prime, or (b) n = (q^e-1)/(q-1) with PSL_e(q) <= G_F <= PGammaL_e(q) acting on points or hyperplanes (e >= 2), or (c) n in {11, 23}. For n = 5^7 = 78125: n is not prime; direct enumeration over all integers q >= 2 and 2 <= e <= 19 gives the single solution (q, e) = (78124, 2) of (q^e-1)/(q-1) = 5^7, and 78124 = 4*19531 is not a prime power; n is not 11 or 23. (Groups of prime-power degree 5^7 with an affine socle contain no element of order 5^7, since every 5-element of AGL(7,5) has order at most 125.) Hence G_F is A_n or S_n. The restatement was checked only through the secondary source (see sec. 8.8).

So D11 is PROVED (cited) given D12. Then D10 is PROVED (cited) given D11.

**8.5.2 Transitivity on blocks. Lemma 8.5.1. PROVED given D10.** The block action pi(G) of the geometric monodromy G is transitive on the d blocks, and h(c,*) is separable.

*Proof.* Q is absolutely irreducible (D10). Since P(c,s) = 2Q(c+s, c-s) with an affine change of variables, P is absolutely irreducible. Its leading coefficient in s is the constant 2a_n, so by Gauss's lemma P is irreducible over K(c). If h(c,*) = h_1 h_2 with positive S-degrees, then P(c,s) = h_1(c,s^2) h_2(c,s^2) is a nontrivial factorisation in K(c)[s], which is impossible. So h(c,*) is irreducible over K(c), and separable since Delta_S != 0 (Lemma 8.1.5). So Gal acts transitively on its roots. [end]

**8.5.3 CERT A. Lemma 8.5.2. PROVED given D7 and Lemma 8.5.1.** Suppose c0 in K satisfies F'(c0) = 0, F''(c0) != 0 and h(c0,*) squarefree. Then N = G intersect F_2^d = F_2^d.

*Proof.* (i) h(c0,0) = 2F'(c0) = 0, and by squarefreeness the root S = 0 of h(c0,*) is simple. By Hensel's lemma there is a root S(c) of h(c,*) in K[[c-c0]] with S(c0) = 0 and dS/dc(c0) = -2F''(c0)/partial _S h(c0,0) != 0 (since partial _c h(c,0) = 2F''(c)). So S(c) has a simple zero at c0.
(ii) The other roots of h(c,*) are simple and nonzero at c0, so they lie in K[[c-c0]] and their sheets are unramified. The two sheets +-sqrt S(c) of the block of S(c) are interchanged by the generator of the inertia group of K((c-c0)). This inertia is tame (p != 2). So the inertia image in G is the sign flip e_{i0} on that block, and e_{i0} in N.
(iii) For g = (epsilon,pi) in G one has g e_i g^{-1} = e_{pi(i)}. So N is stable under pi(G), which is transitive (Lemma 8.5.1). Hence N contains every e_j, i.e. N = F_2^d. [end]

**Status of CERT A (line 0, the line of this entry).** The three conditions of Lemma 8.5.2 hold at the base-field point
c_A = 25165542869611562156214771577253815338782953579437145343258119448900718155215:
F_0'(c_A) = 0, F_0''(c_A) != 0, and the monic polynomial H(c_A, S) of degree 39062 has H(c_A, 0) = 0 and gcd(H, H') = 1. COMPUTED by the team (gcd(F_0', X^p - X) has degree 1) and recomputed from scratch by the verifier of sec. 8.7 (step V6, about 10 seconds). Lemma 8.5.2 turns them into N = F_2^d, so CERT A is COMPUTED + PROVED given D10.

**8.5.4 Primitivity, lifting, Jordan.**

**Lemma 8.5.3 (primitivity). PROVED.** Let Gamma <= S_d be transitive and contain an l-cycle tau with l prime and d/2 < l < d. Then Gamma is primitive.

*Proof.* Suppose Gamma has a block system with m blocks of size b, 1 < b < d, so m = d/b <= d/2 < l. The <tau>-orbits on blocks have size 1 or l, and m < l, so tau fixes every block. A block meeting the support A of tau is tau-invariant, hence contains A. So a block has size b >= l > d/2, contradicting b <= d/2. [end]

**Lemma 8.5.4 (lifting an l-cycle). PROVED.** Let sigma in S_d have a cycle of prime length l, all other cycles of length < l (automatic for l > d/2, since the other cycles have total length d - l < d/2 < l). Let M be the lcm of the other cycle lengths. Then sigma^M is an l-cycle.

*Proof.* Every prime factor of M is at most d - l < l, so gcd(M,l) = 1. On the l-cycle sigma^M is an l-cycle; on each other cycle sigma^M is the identity, since its length divides M. [end]

**Jordan's theorem (Wielandt, Finite Permutation Groups, Thm 13.9; Dixon-Mortimer, Permutation Groups, Thm 3.3E). PROVED (cited).** A primitive group of degree d containing a p-cycle with p prime and p <= d-3 contains A_d. Jordan's theorem in the form used (a primitive group of degree d containing a cycle of prime length l fixing at least three points, i.e. l <= d-3, contains A_d) was confirmed in the statement of arXiv:1209.5169, Thm 1.1; the book numbers are quoted from that paper (the books were not available to us).

**8.5.5 Witness => CERT B. Proposition 8.5.5. PROVED given D13 (sec. 8.6) and Lemma 8.5.1.** Suppose c0 in F_p has Delta_S(c0) != 0 and h(c0,*) has an irreducible factor over F_p of prime degree l with d/2 < l <= d-3. Then pi(G) contains A_d.

*Proof.* Let L be the splitting field of h(c,*) over F_p(c), Gbar_a := Gal(L/F_p(c)) is contained in S_d, and Gbar_g := Gal(L/L intersect K(c)) = pi(G).
(a) Gbar_g is normal in Gbar_a and Gbar_a/Gbar_g ~= Gal((L intersect K(c))/F_p(c)). The finite subextensions of K(c) containing F_p(c) are the constant-field extensions F_{p^m}(c), so this quotient is cyclic and abelian.
(b) Gbar_g is transitive (Lemma 8.5.1), hence so is Gbar_a.
(c) Since Delta_S(c0) != 0 and the leading coefficient is a unit, the splitting cover is unramified over c0. By Dedekind-Kummer, a Frobenius sigma_0 in Gbar_a above c0 has cycle type equal to the factorisation pattern of h(c0,*) over F_p. So sigma_0 has a cycle of length l, and the other cycles have total length d - l < l. Lemma 8.5.4 gives an l-cycle tau = sigma_0^M in Gbar_a.
(d) Gbar_a is primitive (Lemma 8.5.3 applied to tau) and contains an l-cycle with l <= d-3. By Jordan's theorem, Gbar_a contains A_d.
(e) [Gbar_a, Gbar_a] is contained in Gbar_g because the quotient is abelian. Since d >= 5, A_d = [A_d,A_d] is contained in [Gbar_a,Gbar_a] is contained in Gbar_g. [end]

**8.5.6 HK from CERT A and CERT B. Lemma 8.5.6. PROVED given D8 and D9.** If N = F_2^d and pi(G) contains A_d, then G is transitive on X_k(c) for every k <= d-2. In particular HK(k) holds for k <= 6.

*Proof.* Let (sigma_1..sigma_k) and (sigma'_1..sigma'_k) be ordered k-tuples of sheets in pairwise distinct blocks. Since A_d is (d-2)-transitive, choose pi_0 in A_d mapping the blocks of sigma_j to the blocks of sigma'_j, and g in G with pi(g) = pi_0. Then g maps the first tuple to a tuple in the right blocks, with some signs. N = F_2^d contains an element prescribing the signs on those k blocks, so composing gives the target tuple. [end]

### 8.6 CERT B: the witness

#### 8.6.1 The witness

Line j = 0 (the line of this entry), n = 5^7 = 78125, d = (n-1)/2 = 39062, d/2 = 19531.

**WITNESS: c0 = 12894125564123335855227378247026121035387943383342050628014288421295627833647 (in F_p), prime factor degree l = 20269.**

* l = 20269 is prime (trial division), and 19531 < 20269 <= d - 3 = 39059. The window (19531, 39059] holds 1897 primes; the strict inequality l > d/2 matters because 19531 = d/2 is itself prime and Lemmas 8.5.3 and 8.5.4 need l > d/2.
* g := g_{c0} = H(c0, S) is the monic polynomial of degree 39062 defined by F(c0+s) - F(c0-s) = 2 a_n s g(s^2). It is squarefree: gcd(g, g') = 1, so Delta_S(c0) != 0.
* g = f * u with f monic irreducible of degree 20269 and u monic of degree 18793 (u is the product of the remaining irreducible factors, all of degree <= 19531).
* Proposition 8.5.5 applies with this c0 and l, and gives D9 (CERT B).

#### 8.6.2 Two criteria (both PROVED)

**Lemma 8.6.1 (Rabin for prime degree).** A monic f of prime degree l over F_p is irreducible iff (i) x^(p^l) = x (mod f) and (ii) gcd(f, x^p - x) = 1.
*Proof.* (=>) F_p[x]/f = F_(p^l), so x^(p^l) = x, and f has no linear factor. (<=) By (i) f divides x^(p^l) - x, which is squarefree, so f is squarefree and each irreducible factor has degree dividing l, i.e. 1 or l. By (ii) there is none of degree 1. [end]

**Lemma 8.6.2 (composition).** Let P_a in F_p[x], deg P_a < l, satisfy P_a = x^(p^a) (mod f). Then P_(a+b) = P_a(P_b(x)) mod f. So R_0 = x^p mod f, R_j = R_(j-1) o R_(j-1) mod f gives R_j = x^(p^(2^j)) mod f, and a binary product of the R_j gives x^(p^l) mod f.
*Proof.* In A = F_p[x]/f, phi(y) = y^p is a ring endomorphism fixing F_p, so phi^b(P_a(theta)) = P_a(phi^b(theta)) = P_a(P_b(theta)) and phi^(a+b)(theta) = phi^b(phi^a(theta)). [end]

**Lemma 8.6.3 (criterion modulo g, no factor needed).** Let g in F_p[x] be monic and squarefree of degree d, and l a prime with 2l > d. Then g has an irreducible factor of degree l iff deg gcd(g, x^(p^l) - x) - deg gcd(g, x^p - x) = l, and then there is exactly one such factor, equal to gcd(g, x^(p^l) - x) / gcd(g, x^p - x).
*Proof.* gcd(g, x^(p^l) - x) is the product of the irreducible factors of g whose degree divides l, i.e. degree 1 or l, and gcd(g, x^p - x) is the product of those of degree 1. The difference of degrees is l times the number of factors of degree l; there is at most one since 2l > d. [end]

#### 8.6.3 Certification 1: modulo f (team engine)

A GPU program of the team (`certb_fast.cu`, Kaltofen-Shoup distinct-degree factorisation with baby and giant steps; checked against python-flint on random and planted inputs, as described in its README) was run on centres chosen at random; no selection was applied other than "the residual factor has prime degree in the window", and for c0 it returned the pair (f, u) with f * u = g. The proof does not rely on the factorisation program. It relies on the following exact checks of the returned data, which a second program of the team ran (log `certify.log`, result PASS, 6.7 s): (1) f * u = g exactly, with f and u monic; (2) gcd(g, g') = 1; (3) R_0 = x^p mod f, and gcd(f, R_0 - x) = 1; (4) the doubling edges R_j = R_(j-1) o R_(j-1) mod f (15 were checked, j = 1..15; j = 1..14 are used); (5) the binary chain for l = 20269 = 1 + 4 + 8 + 32 + 256 + 512 + 1024 + 2048 + 16384 (bits 0, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14) reaches x^(p^l) = x mod f. By Lemma 8.6.1 and Lemma 8.6.2, f is irreducible of degree 20269.

#### 8.6.4 Certification 2: modulo g (the referee's route, no data needed)

By Lemma 8.6.3 the same fact is certified from c0 and l alone: compute R_0 = x^p mod g, R_j = R_(j-1) o R_(j-1) mod g for j = 1..14, Q = x^(p^l) mod g by the binary chain, g_l = gcd(g, Q - x), g_1 = gcd(g, R_0 - x), and check deg g_l - deg g_1 = 20269. This is step V5 of the verifier of sec. 8.7; it uses a different library (python-flint) and a different modulus (g of degree 39062, not f of degree 20269) than certification 1. The verifier also prints the SHA-256 of f = g_l / g_1, of u = g / f and of R_j mod f, to be compared with the table above.

#### 8.6.5 Why the data are not shipped, and what the certificate document proposed

The certificate document of the team (checks C0-C4) proposed to ship the witness data with a manifest of hashes: F (2.5 MB), g (1.25 MB), the Bezout pair for squarefreeness (2.5 MB), f, u, the checkpoints R_j and a second Bezout pair, in all 18 to 30 MB. That is far above the organizer limits (evidence at most 524,288 bytes; no undeclared files), so nothing of it is shipped. Instead the package states c0, l and the digests above, and ships the verifier (section 10, `certb_verify.py`, 10 KB) that regenerates every object from the organizer constants. The differences from the certificate document are: (a) F is rebuilt (V1) instead of read from a file, and the hash of the rebuilt F equals the hash of the team's coefficient file, which closes the open item of that document about identifying the line model of the decomposition code with the interpolated F; (b) squarefreeness is checked by gcd(g, g') = 1 instead of shipped Bezout coefficients (same statement, recomputed); (c) the C0 random test of the certificate document is replaced by the exact interpolation of V1 plus the straight-line reference check; (d) irreducibility of f is replaced by Lemma 8.6.3, which needs no f.
What this means for a reader: the judge of this entry cannot recompute the witness inside the review. A referee can, in the time stated in sec. 8.7.

### 8.7 What a referee recomputes, and what it costs

**Tool.** `certb_verify.py` (section 10; 10 KB; Python 3 and python-flint 0.9.0). **Inputs.** The organizer's constants file `orchard-pallas-constants.json` (the file the program constants of `pallas_consts.h` come from), the line j = 0, the witness `c0` and `l = 20269` of sec. 8.6.1, and the CERT A point `c_A` of sec. 8.5.3. No other file is needed. Call: `python certb_verify.py orchard-pallas-constants.json 12894125564123335855227378247026121035387943383342050628014288421295627833647 20269 0 25165542869611562156214771577253815338782953579437145343258119448900718155215`.

**Cost of V5 in other terms.** The 22 compositions modulo a degree-39062 polynomial dominate. Modulo f (degree 20269, certification 1) the same chain took 6.7 s on the team's GPU engine; that engine is not part of the package. The team's data files for certification 1 (about 13 MB) are not part of this package (sec. 8.6.5).

**Inner polynomials of V7 (line 0).** SHA-256 of H_m, coefficients constant term first, 32-byte little-endian. The same six polynomials were produced by the team's earlier separate code (`nondecomp_witnesses`; its file hashes, taken over hex text, begin 8840f75ffdc024bc, c9553028674f6ef3, cd73efecd2a4c9a3, d72656b6173cfb62, bf47a0287b093b15, 63a7deaaa8a4716c); that code also holds 12 witnesses for lines 1 and 2, which this entry does not use (18 in total).

**What the verifier does not cover, stated plainly.** (1) The cited theorems (sec. 8.8) are not recomputed. (2) The reference hash of V1 is a straight-line implementation inside the verifier (rounds 0-3, 4, 60-63 with the organizer constants); the two certificates of the package are checked by the organizer's hash. (3) The transcription of the lemmas of sec. 8.1-8.6 is a matter for reading, not for computation. (4) The complete run of the shipped verifier on the final data finished with all PASS lines in 6,635 s: deg gcd(g, x^(p^l) - x) = 20271 and deg gcd(g, x^p - x) = 2 (so the degree-l part has degree 20269), and the printed SHA-256 of f, u and R_0..R_14 mod f equal the tables of sec. 8.6.3. The team's compiled engine (C/CUDA, not part of the package) did the equivalent chain modulo f in 6.7 s on one RTX 3090; the referee time is therefore about two hours in pure Python, not minutes.

### 8.8 Scope, status of the cited theorems, attack points

* **Scope.** Section 8 is for r = 1 only, for the line j = 0 used by the program, one attempt, one centre. The method gives nothing at r = 3 and is not used for r = 2 here.
* **Status of our check of each cited theorem** (from our citation check of 2026-10-13; the primary sources were not available to us, which we say plainly).
  Jordan's theorem: statement confirmed (arXiv:1209.5169, Thm 1.1: primitive group of degree n containing a cycle of prime length fixing at least three points contains A_n); the book numbers (Wielandt Thm 13.9, Dixon-Mortimer Thm 3.3E) are taken from that paper.
  Feit/Mueller classification in the form of Jones, arXiv:1209.5169, Thm 1.2 (group-theoretic, so no transfer between characteristics is needed): we took the form stated in the certificate document of the team; we did not read the text of Theorem 1.2 ourselves. The polynomial-monodromy version (Mueller's list, in Burda-Khovanskii arXiv:1209.5137, Thm 7, a characteristic-0 statement) leaves only A_n or S_n for n = 5^7 as well, because n is odd and composite; we do not use it.
  Fried's criterion: statement confirmed in Kreso-Tichy arXiv:1503.05401, Thm 3.3 (hypothesis: the characteristic does not divide deg f; for composite n the Dickson exception cannot occur); the 1970 paper was not read.
  Riemann-Hurwitz, Hasse-Weil, Dedekind-Kummer, Gauss's lemma, Lueroth's theorem, Tonelli-Shanks: standard.
* **Open premises of section 8.** None in the probability chain other than D18 (ideal randomness, stated in `claim.json`) and the cited theorems above. The cap loss is a proved term (sec. 8.3), not an assumption. Nothing in section 8 is a sample or a heuristic.
* **Attack points for a referee.** The form of the classification theorem for n = 5^7 (sec. 8.5.1 (iii)); Fried's criterion for Q (sec. 8.5.1); uniqueness of the inner polynomial (sec. 8.5.1 (i)); the Dedekind-Kummer step at c0 (sec. 8.5.5 (c)); the lifting and primitivity lemmas (8.5.3, 8.5.4); the local-inertia argument for CERT A (Lemma 8.5.2); the genus bound (Proposition 8.1.7) and the fibre comparison (Lemma 8.1.8); the abandonment inequality (sec. 8.3.2); the chain of sec. 8.2.

**Supporting statements on the charges.**
**H1 (supporting).** The charges of section 4.2 describe the executed program: every statement that executes a field operation, a load or store, or an index, address or branch operation carries its charge on the same line; the block and position kernels are straight-line generated code in which each executed line is charged exactly once, and every loop is charged per executed iteration as written in the loop. The block register file (18 words: 16 data words and two working words) is a disclosed assumption.
**H2 (supporting).** For the levels of stage E other than the first, the charge of a level is bounded by 1.02 times the measured cost at the maximum degree of that level (shift and powering) or the table value (gcd and division). This enters only the worst-case ledger of a branch that is entered with probability below `2^-36` beyond a level of degree 3, and not the probability.


## 9. What is and is not provided

* Provided: the algebraic derivation (sections 2-3), the root-isolation proof (4.1), the half-gcd facts (4.4), the executed algorithm and its charges (4, 6, 7), the complete C source of the instrumented program (section 10), 2 machine-checked collision certificates (`certificates/`, checked by the organizer's hash).
  The success-probability proof is section 8 (final); its computed inputs are recomputed by `certb_verify.py` (section 10) in the time stated in section 8.7; the witness data themselves (several MB) are not shipped.
* No Python experiment is declared: the experiment runner sizes the digest from the digest of the empty message, which the Orchard digest (exactly two 32-byte field encodings) does not define.
* The package contains only the certificates, so the C source is part of this document (section 10) as text, and the program reads no input file. The counts of section 6 are the output of that source compiled with `gcc -O3 -DDEG_CAP=6` and run as `single <seed> 1`; the calibrations as `calib 4 9`, the gcd bounds as `gcdbound H`.
* The worst case of stage E is charged although it has not been observed: it needs a centre for which `g_c` has a very large number of roots that are squares. It is derived, not run end to end; the components were run at the sizes of the levels (`calib`, `gcdbound`) and the half-gcd was run against classical Euclid on planted gcds (`test_hgcd`); the cap bounds the root isolation to degrees at most 6, so `test_split` (degrees up to 12000) is not part of the evidence of this entry.
* The cost claim assumes the model of section 4.2; in particular word-level costs beyond the charged loads, stores and control operations (cache, bandwidth) are not part of it.

## 10. Complete source of the instrumented program

Counters: `LD(n)`, `ST(n)` add `n` to the load or store counter and `n` to the control counter (address operations), `CTL(n)` adds `n` to the control counter, `loopc(n)` adds `3n + 2` to the control counter; every `fp_*` call increments the counter of its own kind
(`fp_add`, `fp_sub`, `fp_mul`, `fp_sqr`; `fp_neg` is one subtraction); `X.perm += k` adds `k` primitive operations; `snap()`/`snap_restore()` read and restore all counters. Buffers are obtained from the tracked allocator (`NEW_FP`).
The files are shown in full, in the order: `common.h`, `common.c`, `pallas.h`, `pallas.c`, `pallas_consts.h`, `attack.h`, `hgcd.h`, `gcd_bounds.h`, `ntt.c`, `gen_kern.py`, `ntt_kern.h`, `ntt_a3.h`, `poly.c`, `lean.c`, `line.c`, `split.c`, `hgcd.c`, `single.c`, `test_hgcd.c`, `test_split.c`, `test_keep.c`, `calib.c`, `gcdbound.c`, `certb_verify.py`.
`pallas_consts.h` holds the deployed Orchard constants (round constants, MDS, field constants) as Montgomery limbs. `gcd_bounds.h` is generated by `gcdbound H`. `certb_verify.py` is the referee verifier of section 8.7 (not part of the counted program; it reads the organizer constants file and the witness numbers of section 8.6). `test_hgcd.c`, `test_split.c`, `test_keep.c`, `calib.c` and `gcdbound.c` are the test, calibration and bound programs named above.

```python
"""Generates ntt_kern.h (straight-line register-block kernels and whole pass functions) and ntt_a3.h (straight-line radix-3 position
kernels and their region drivers) for ntt.c.  Every generated statement that executes loads, stores, integer or address operations
carries its charge on the same line (LD / ST / CTL); field operations are charged by pallas.c.  Nothing in a kernel is a loop or a branch.

Register file (disclosed assumption): a block keeps 2^k <= 16 data words x[] of 256 bits in registers; the twiddle operand, the
butterfly temporary and the radix-3 constants are charged as loads where they are used, and need 2 further working words.
Integer values (strides, shift counts, base pointers) are held in integer registers."""
