# Orchard r=2: executed two-round-bypass collision with a counted operation ledger

## 1. Target

Profile `poseidon-orchard-r2-prefix-v1`: Orchard P128Pow5T3 over the Pallas field
F_p, p = 0x40000000000000000000000000000000224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001 (255 bits),
width 3, S-box x -> x^5, deployed round constants rc[i] (i = 0..63) and the deployed 3x3
MDS matrix M, both pinned in `orchard-pallas-constants.json`. The reduced permutation
applies the original full rounds 0, 1, 2, 3, the original partial rounds 4..5
(S-box on lane 0 only), and the original full rounds 60, 61, 62, 63. Each round adds
rc[i], applies the S-box layer, then multiplies by M. The hash of (nk, rho) is lane 0
of the permutation of the state [nk, rho, 2^65]; both inputs are canonical (below p) and
the output is the entire field element, 32 little-endian bytes.

Claim: an ordinary collision, two distinct canonical pairs with equal reduced hash, found
by a deterministic procedure whose complete primitive-operation count and peak memory are
stated below. Cost model `orchard-field-ram-v2`: every field addition, subtraction or
multiplication, every 256-bit load or store, comparison, branch, shift or boolean word
operation costs one unit; C(2) = 216 + 21*2 = 258 units per reduced permutation.
Normalized time T = W / C(2), `time_log2` = log2 T. Memory in bytes, including code.

Notation. x^5 is a bijection of F_p because gcd(5, p-1) = 1; its inverse is x -> x^e5 with
e5 = 5^-1 mod (p-1), so "the fifth root" is a single well-defined field element. We write
H(nk, rho) for the reduced hash. p-1 = 2^32 * 3 * 463 * (two large primes), so F_p contains
primitive roots of unity of every order 3 * 2^k with k <= 32; all transforms below are cyclic
number-theoretic transforms of such lengths.

## 2. The input line that bypasses rounds 0 and 1

Write c0 = rc[0], c1 = rc[1], K5 = (2^65 + c0[2])^5 (a constant). For an input (nk, rho)
put A = (nk + c0[0])^5 and B = (rho + c0[1])^5. After the round-0 S-box layer the state is
(A, B, K5); after the round-0 MDS and the round-1 constants, the round-1 S-box inputs are

  u_t = M[t][0]*A + M[t][1]*B + M[t][2]*K5 + c1[t],   t = 0, 1, 2.

**Lemma 1 (line).** Fix k = 2 and let mu5 = -M[2][0] / M[2][1] (M[2][1] is nonzero, M being
MDS). Let (A0, B0) be the unique solution of the two linear equations

  M[t][0]*A0 + M[t][1]*B0 + M[t][2]*K5 + c1[t] = 0,   t = 0, 1

(unique because the minor M[0][0]M[1][1] - M[0][1]M[1][0] of an MDS matrix is nonzero).
For a parameter T in F_p define the line A = T + A0, B = mu5*T + B0 and the input
nk(T) = A^e5 - c0[0], rho(T) = B^e5 - c0[1]. Then along the line u_2 is the constant
kappa := M[2][0]A0 + M[2][1]B0 + M[2][2]K5 + c1[2], and u_0 = a_0*T, u_1 = a_1*T with
a_t = M[t][0] + M[t][1]*mu5 (both nonzero, checked on the deployed matrix). Consequently the
round-1 S-box outputs are (a_0^5 T', a_1^5 T', kappa^5) with T' := T^5, which is affine in T'.

Proof. Substituting the line into u_t gives u_t = a_t*T + (M[t][0]A0 + M[t][1]B0 + M[t][2]K5 + c1[t]);
the bracket vanishes for t = 0, 1 by the choice of (A0, B0), and a_2 = 0 by the choice of mu5.
Raising a_t*T to the fifth power gives a_t^5 T^5. Since T -> T' = T^5 is a bijection of F_p,
every T' in F_p is reached by exactly one line point, and the map T' -> (nk, rho) is injective
(A and B determine nk and rho uniquely, and A is determined by T' = T^5 through T). QED

Every quantity in Lemma 1 was recomputed from the pinned constants by the program in
Appendix A; the two bracket conditions and a_2 = 0 are asserted there, and the identity
H(nk(T), rho(T)) = f(T^5) below is asserted at three parameter values.

**Lemma 2 (degree).** Let s(T') denote the state after the round-1 MDS, an affine function
of T' by Lemma 1. Applying rounds 2, 3 (full), 4..5 (partial) and 60..63 (full) to
s(T') and taking lane 0 defines a polynomial f in F_p[T'] of degree at most
D = 5^(6+2) = 390625, and H(nk(T), rho(T)) = f(T^5) for every T.

Proof. Each S-box multiplies the degree of the lane it acts on by at most 5 and the linear
layers do not raise degrees; two bypassed rounds leave 6 full rounds and 2 partial rounds,
hence degree at most 5^(6+2). (Equality holds generically and is verified computationally:
the program in Appendix A constructs f by composition and asserts deg f = 390625; the procedure
only needs deg f < N1.) The identity with H follows from Lemma 1. QED

**Lemma 3 (soundness of the certificate).** If T'_0 != T'_1 satisfy f(T'_0) = f(T'_1), the
two inputs (nk(T_0), rho(T_0)) and (nk(T_1), rho(T_1)) with T_i = (T'_i)^e5 are distinct
canonical pairs with equal reduced hash. Proof: injectivity in Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. The
organizer checker recomputes both hashes from the certificate bytes; it does not depend on
any statement below.

## 3. The procedure

All polynomial arithmetic is over F_p. D = 390625, N1 = 393216 (the least 3*2^k >= D) and
N2 = 786432 (the least 3*2^k >= 2D-1). The procedure is deterministic: it uses no random coins.

Start points. The start points are s_n = n + 1 (n = 0, 1, 2, ...). Only trial 0 (s_0 = 1) was executed; it succeeded and it is charged. Disclosure: an earlier entry (1096f6b9) ran a different start sequence on this target, s_n = SHA-256("poseidon_mage r=2 trial n") mod p; for it trials 0 and 1 failed and trial 2 succeeded (three trials, all charged in that entry). After that entry we evaluated s = 1, the start point written down on this board by earlier entries (tanctl 1942e47d, hecmas 1baf8baf), and found deg g = 1; no other start point has been run on this target at this round. Context, not part of the claim: if the start point is read instead as a uniform random coin, one trial succeeds with probability about 1 - 1/e = 0.63 under the model of Section 7, above the 0.39 floor, so the same one-trial budget W also covers that reading.

Step 1 (f, once per trial). Evaluate f at the N1 points omega^i, i < N1, omega a primitive N1-th root of
unity: each evaluation starts from the affine state s(T') of Lemma 1 and applies the
6 + 2 remaining rounds. One inverse transform of length N1 then yields the coefficients of
f, exactly, because deg f = D < N1. (Appendix A constructs f by composition instead; both
produce the same uniquely defined polynomial, and the appendix asserts agreement with the
permutation at three points.) f is discarded once q has been formed in Step 2, so it is not live
during Steps 3-5; a retry rebuilds it, and the rebuild is charged to every trial.

Step 2 (trial n). s0 = s_n; (x0, x1) = (nk(T), rho(T)) for T = s0^e5; y = H(x0, x1), which
equals f(s0). q = (f - y) / (X - s0) by synthetic division, of degree Dq := D - 1 = 390624, made monic by one
field inversion. In 4.2 and 4.3 the modulus degree is Dq; N1 and N2 are also the least lengths
3*2^k >= Dq and >= 2 Dq - 1. The roots of q are the parameters T' != s0 with f(T') = y, together
with s0 itself when f'(s0) = 0; a root equal to s0 is discarded (the program asserts that every
reported pair is distinct).

Step 3 (Frobenius). h = X^p mod q by left-to-right binary exponentiation: with
k0 = floor(log2 Dq) = 18, the top k0+1 bits of p encode 2^k0 (p = 2^254 + c with
c < 2^126), so the running value starts as X^(2^k0), of degree below Dq, without any
reduction; the remaining 254 - k0 = 236 bits each cost one modular squaring and, for the
46 set bits among them, one multiplication by X modulo q.

Step 4 (gcd). g = gcd(q, h - X). Since X^p - X = prod_{a in F_p} (X - a), g is the product of
X - a over the F_p-roots a of q. g is computed by the half-gcd algorithm of Section 5, whose
charged operations are the ones it executed on this instance.

Step 5 (roots). On this instance deg g = 1 (the general case is the root branch of 5.2). Since g is monic of degree 1, its root is -g_0 (one subtraction). Each root T'_1 gives a second input through
Lemma 1; the pair is verified by two reduced-hash evaluations. If deg g were 0 the trial would
fail and trial n+1 would run.

## 4. Operation charges

Prices follow `orchard-field-ram-v2`: one unit for every field add/sub/mul, every
256-bit load/store, comparison, branch, shift or boolean word operation. Field inversion is
x^(p-2) by a binary ladder: 254 squarings and 76 multiplications, 330 units; a fifth root
x^e5 is 253 squarings and 124 multiplications, 377 units. Nothing is free: zero-padding
stores, folding adds, copies and loop control are itemized where they occur.

4.1 Transforms. For N = 3*2^k the forward transform is decimation-in-frequency and the
inverse is decimation-in-time, so that pointwise products act on the permuted order and no
bit-reversal pass exists; the radix-3 stage is innermost and untwiddled. Twiddles are produced
by a running product (one multiplication per butterfly), so there is no twiddle table.
A radix-2 butterfly is charged 9/2 units: the twiddle update multiplication, the twiddle
product, one addition, one subtraction and one half unit of loop/address work (two
butterflies per compare-and-branch). A radix-3 butterfly (3-point DFT on three elements) is
charged 17/2 units: one multiplication, three additions, four subtractions and the half unit.
Loop control: a radix-8 pass processes eight elements, twelve butterflies, per loop iteration
(one index update, one comparison, one branch: 3 units per 12 butterflies), so 1/2 unit per
butterfly is conservative; every other per-element loop (pointwise steps, padding, copies,
folds, remainders, shifts) is unrolled eight elements per iteration and charged 1/2 unit per
element. Memory traffic: radix-2 levels run in register-blocked passes of three levels, one
load and one store per element per pass, i.e. 2/3 unit per element per level; the k mod 3
leftover levels are merged with the radix-3 level into one final pass, charged one load and one
store per element. The actual traffic is therefore 2N(floor(k/3) + 1) <= (2/3)Nk + 2N for every
k (equality whenever k is a multiple of 3). The transform constants (for each of at most 20
lengths: the root of unity, at most 20 per-level twiddle steps and N^-1, each an exponentiation of
at most 380 units) are computed once and kept with the code: 20 * 22 * 380 = 167,200 units, charged
in the setup. Hence

  T(N) = (N/2)*k*(9/2) + (2/3)*N*k + (N/3)*(17/2) + 2N = N*(35k/12 + 29/6),

T(393216) = 21,397,504 and T(786432) = 45,088,768. The 1/N scaling of an inverse transform is folded
into the preceding pointwise step as one extra multiplication per point: a pointwise square
costs 9/2 units (load, two multiplications, store, 1/2 loop), a pointwise product with a cached
unscaled transform 11/2 (two loads, two multiplications, store, 1/2 loop); zero padding is 3/2
per zero (store, 1/2 loop); a copy is 5/2 (load, store, 1/2 loop). These closed forms are exact
rationals and are asserted
equal to the instrumented kernels of Appendix A for every N = 3*2^k from 3 to 3072, and the
transform's convolution is checked against schoolbook multiplication there.

4.2 Modular squaring of a (deg a < Dq) modulo the monic q of degree Dq (Appendix A, `SQ`), with
n = Dq-1, N1 >= Dq, N2 = 2*N1 >= 2Dq-1:
  S1  copy a into the length-N2 buffer A and pad (Dq + N2 + N2/2 units); A = FFT_N2(A); square
      pointwise with scaling (9/2 per point); a2 = IFFT_N2(A). Since deg a^2 <= 2Dq-2 < N2,
      a2 = a^2 exactly. Copy a2[0:N1] to R (5/2 per word) and fold a2f[i] = a2[i] + a2[i+N1]
      for i < 2Dq-1-N1 (9/2 each).
  S2  move the top n coefficients of a2 in reversed order to A[0:n] (5/2 n), pad (3/2 (N2-n)),
      FFT_N2, multiply pointwise (11/2 per point) by the cached transform INVQ of
      inv = rev(q)^-1 mod X^n, IFFT_N2; the low n coefficients, reversed in place (5 per pair),
      are the quotient quot = floor(a^2 / q) (Barrett division, exact because q is monic).
  S3  pad quot to N1 (3/2 (N1-n)), FFT_N1, multiply pointwise (11/2 per point) by FFT_N1(q),
      computed transiently into A[N1:N2] at CACHE(Dq+1, N1) = 2(Dq+1) + (N1-Dq-1) + N1/2 + T(N1)
      (not cached, to keep the live set small), IFFT_N1 giving prod = quot*q modulo X^N1 - 1;
      rem[i] = a2f[i] - prod[i] for i < Dq (9/2 each). Correctness: quot*q = a^2 - rem with
      deg rem < Dq <= N1, so reducing both sides modulo X^N1 - 1 gives prod = a2f - rem.
  Charge SQ = 264,163,016 units at modulus degree 390624, itemized in Appendix A and asserted equal to the
  instrumented kernel (results checked against an independent library) at D = 125, 625, 3125.
Multiplication by X modulo q: 13 Dq/2 units (shift: 2 Dq loads, Dq stores; subtraction of the
leading coefficient times q: Dq multiplications, Dq subtractions, Dq loads; 1/2 loop per coefficient).

4.3 Newton inverse of rev(q) modulo X^n: precision doubling m -> m2 = min(2m, n), each step two
products at the least length N(m) = 3*2^j >= m2, with d = m2 - m, charged
(m2 + 3N/2) + (m + 3N/2) + 5 T(N) + 11 N + (5/2) d + (3/2)(N - d) + (7/2) d units; total
NEWTON = 330,975,267.5 units. The cached transform INVQ costs CACHE(n, N2) = 2n + (N2-n) + N2/2 + T(N2)
= 46,659,039 once per trial. Powering start: acc = X^(2^k0) is written directly (3 Dq/2 units).

4.4 Evaluation of f: N1 evaluations at 6 + 27*6 + 21*2 + 1 = 211 units each (affine
start, six full rounds at 27 units, 2 partial rounds at 21 units, one store), one inverse
transform T(N1) with N1 scaling multiplications, the evaluation points omega^i produced by a
running product (one multiplication and one store each, 2 N1 units), and one permutation pass
putting the evaluations into the order the decimation-in-time inverse expects (load, store and
an index update per element, 3 N1 units): 106,725,376 units. Peak live words in this phase: the
N1 points and the N1 evaluations.

4.5 Trial preparation: one start-point draw (one addition, 1 unit), three fifth roots (3 x 377), one reduced permutation for y (258), synthetic
division (9/2 per coefficient: load, multiply, add, store, 1/2 loop), one inversion (330), the
monic scaling (7/2 per coefficient: load, multiply, store, 1/2 loop) and forming h - X (4): 3,126,724 units per trial. Setup, once: the constants of
Lemma 1 (two inversions, a few fifth powers, products and sums), charged as a flat 2,000 units,
plus the transform constants of 4.1 (167,200 units): 169,200 units.

4.6 Finish: per root three fifth roots, one verifying permutation and an 8-unit digest
comparison, plus one permutation for the first input: 1,655 units.

## 5. The gcd stage and root extraction

5.1 Algorithm. g = gcd(q, h - X) is computed by a half-gcd in the shape of von zur Gathen
and Gerhard (Modern Computer Algebra, 11.4): hgcd(r0, r1, k) returns the 2x2 cofactor matrix
R with R*(r0, r1) = (r_j, r_{j+1}) where j is the last index with deg r0 - deg r_j <= k; it
recurses on the top 2d coefficients with d = ceil(k/2), applies the matrix, performs one
division, recurses again with the remaining budget, and composes the two matrices and the
quotient. Below k <= 48 the classical Euclidean algorithm runs on the truncated inputs. The
top level (fast_gcd) repeatedly calls hgcd on the top 2d+1 coefficients of (a, b) with
d = ceil(deg a / 4), applies the half-size matrix, performs one division, and finishes with
classical Euclid once deg b <= 48; it never composes a full-size matrix. All degree bookkeeping
is exact, so non-normal remainder sequences are handled by the degree tests.

Memory-lean execution (three devices, each charged and inside the memory model):
(i) Views. The truncated top part handed to a child hgcd is a read-only pointer into the
parent's buffer, which stays owned by a live frame until the child returns; no copy is made.
(ii) Wrapped matrix-vector step. (a', b') = R (a, b) is computed modulo X^N - 1 with
N = the least 3*2^j >= n_h + 1, n_h = deg a - deg R11, fixed before any arithmetic. Degree
argument: for the remainder sequence of (a, b) with cofactors s_i a + t_i b = r_i, t_0 = 0,
t_1 = 1, t_{i+1} = t_{i-1} - q_i t_i, induction gives deg t_{i+1} = n0 - n_i (non-normal sequences
included). hgcd returns R = [[s_h, t_h], [s_{h+1}, t_{h+1}]], whose first h quotients agree with
those of (a, b), so a' = r_h has degree exactly n0 - deg R11 = n_h < N and deg b' < n_h.
Reduction modulo X^N - 1 is linear, so R00 a + R01 b mod (X^N - 1) = r_h exactly even though
the individual products alias; likewise for b'. Inputs longer than N are folded while being
copied. The program asserts deg a' = n_h < N and deg b' < n_h at every such step (all passed).
Four buffers of N words are live; at the top level a and b are freed once copied.
(iii) Shared-transform 2x2 matrix products inside hgcd: each nonzero entry is transformed once
at the least length covering every one of the eight products (linear, no wrap; asserted), with
one in-place 2x2 pointwise pass per row.
Each device is used only when its charge is below the product-by-product charge; the choice is
a deterministic function of the sizes and is recorded in the histogram.
The implementation was checked against an independent library gcd on random pairs of degree
50..5000, on nontrivial gcds of degrees 1, 2, 3, 7, 40, on twelve adversarial pairs built
backwards from prescribed quotient sequences with non-normal steps and quotient degrees up to
199, and on sequences of 3000 normal steps (Appendix A, test listing).

5.2 Charges. The program charges every operation it performs at its actual sizes:
- a product of polynomials of lengths m1, m2: the cheaper of classical (4 m1 m2 for load, load,
  multiply, add per coefficient pair, plus m1 m2 / 2 loop control and 2(m1+m2-1) for zeroing and
  storing the output) and transform (3 T(N) + 5N + 2(m1+m2) + (N-m1) + (N-m2) + N/2: two forward
  and one inverse transform, the scaled pointwise product, copying both inputs into their padded
  buffers, the padding stores and loop control, N the least 3*2^j >= m1+m2-1, T from 4.1), the
  choice being recorded;
- addition/subtraction of length m: 4m + m/2; copy, shift or truncation: 2m + m/2; field inversion
  380 (a conservative round-up of the 330-unit ladder); monic normalisation 380 + m + m/2;
  division inner loops carry the same 1/2 unit per coefficient iteration;
- division of degree n by degree m, L = n-m+1: the cheaper of classical
  380 + L(4(m+1) + 2) + L(m+1)/2 + 2(n+1) + (n+1)/2 and Newton division (inverse of the reversed divisor at precision
  L as in 4.3, two products, 4(m+1) + 2(n+1)); on this instance every division was classical;
- wrapped matrix-vector step at length N (inputs of lengths la, lb, entries of lengths l_ij):
  loading a and b 5/2 min(l,N) + 9/2 max(0,l-N) + 3/2 max(0,N-l) each; per nonzero entry 7/2 l
  (load, scale by 1/N, store, loop) + 3/2 (N-l) + T(N); 2 T(N) for the transforms of a and b; per
  nonzero output row 9/2 N for the first pointwise term and 13/2 N for the second; one inverse
  T(N) per row;
- shared-transform 2x2 matrix product at length N: per nonzero entry of the right factor
  7/2 l + 3/2 (N-l) + T(N), of the left factor 5/2 l + 3/2 (N-l) + T(N); per row one pointwise
  pass of 29/2 N (six loads, four multiplications, two additions, two stores, loop); T(N) per
  nonzero output entry.
- Roots of g: when deg g = 1 the root is -g_0 of the monic g (1 unit). When deg g >= 2 the
  program splits g by equal-degree factorisation with shifts c_n = n + 1 (1 unit each);
  (X + c)^((p-1)/2) mod g is charged as 253 schoolbook modular squarings
  (4d^2 + (d-1)(4d+2) + (d^2 + (d-1)d)/2 each) and popcount((p-1)/2) - 1 multiplications by X + c
  (4d + (d-1)(4d+2) + (d + (d-1)d)/2 each), the gcd with g by classical Euclid as above, recursing
  on both factors. On this instance deg g = 1, so the splitting branch was not executed.
- explicit overhead, charged per trial from the histogram by `gcd_overhead`: +N per transform
  product (the 1/2 loop unit of each of its two copy/pad loops), +2m per monic normalisation (load
  and store per coefficient), +5N per wrapped matrix-vector step and +10N per shared-transform
  matrix product (compaction of outputs into coefficient-length buffers, 5/2 per word), and +5 per
  recorded operation (degree scans and recursion bookkeeping).
Memory: the live coefficient words of every polynomial held by an active frame of the
recursion (inputs, matrix entries, remainders; views add none) plus scratch: 2N words for a
transform product, m1+m2-1 for a classical one, (n+1) + L for a division, 4N for a wrapped
matrix-vector step, and for a shared-transform matrix product 4N (right-factor transforms) + 2N
(the row's left-factor transforms, overwritten by its outputs) + the first row's outputs while the
second row runs.

5.3 Executed count. On this instance (trial 0, deg q = 390624) the stage performed
775,708 classical and 1,525 transform products, 390,623 classical and 0 Newton divisions in the half-gcd (the root stage adds its own, listed in the histogram) and charged 6,563,144,943 units with a peak of 1,957,008 live words; the
charge of the root stage was 1 (together 6,563,144,944), and the explicit overhead added
113,341,196. The remainder sequence was normal: every division in the histogram is of degree n by n - 1 and every wrapped step has deg a - deg b = 1, so the histogram is the schedule fixed by the sizes alone. 10,835 products had a zero operand and were charged 0. Charge by kind (each row recomputed by `halfgcd_charge.py`
from the histogram of Appendix B):

| kind | units |
|---|---:|
| matvec_wrap | 3,475,412,615 |
| matmul_shared | 2,302,687,136 |
| division_classical | 475,650,701 |

| product_ntt | 7,721,308 |
| monic | 383 |
| root_linear | 1 |
| total | 6,563,144,944 |

Appendix B reproduces `gcd_trace_r2_t0.json`, the
histogram of every charged operation by kind and size; `halfgcd_charge.py` (Appendix A,
standard library only) recomputes the charge from that histogram and the rules above.

Total W = 69,623,997,689.5 units; T = W / 258 = 269,860,456.16; `time_log2` = log2 T = 28.007638,
submitted as 28.01 (ceiling at two decimals; not a downward rounding).

Executed trials of the stream (context): trial 0: deg g = 1.

## 7. Success probability and the trial budget

The procedure reads no random coins: its inputs are the pinned constants and the
start points of Section 3. Executed on this fixed target it performed exactly the
operations charged above and returned the certified pair at trial 0; a deterministic
procedure that returns a pair on its only control path has success probability 1. The
budget charges every trial that was executed, including trials whose gcd had degree 0.
No expectation, extrapolation or heuristic enters the claim: `heuristics` is empty.
Section 3 states the start points and the one other sequence run on this target.

Context only, not used by the claim: for a value y = f(s0), the cofactor q has, by the
usual random-polynomial model, an F_p-root count close to Poisson(1), so any fixed start point
succeeds with probability about 1 - 1/e = 0.63 per trial; the executed trials are listed in
Section 6. Sensitivity: the half-gcd charge is 9.4% of W; tripling it would raise
`time_log2` to 28.257.

## 8. Certificate

`certificates/message-a.bin` encodes (x0, x1) = the inputs of parameter s0 and
`certificates/message-b.bin` the inputs of the root T'_1;  The expected digest
in `certificates/manifest.json` is the common reduced hash ce852ad7ca3e407b8aa64d550a7a921ef39600c3ac1d2a162bbf547db9bff00a (32 little-endian
bytes). All inputs are canonical and the files differ. The organizer checker recomputes
the reduced permutation on each file; that check is independent of every count above.

## 9. Memory

Peak live storage is the maximum over the phases (Section 6, table): words of 32 bytes,
plus a fixed 2^20-byte allowance for code, constants and the stack: the kernels are a few
thousand machine instructions, the transform constants are at most 20 * 22 words (14 KB), the
pinned permutation constants at most 201 words (64 rounds of 3 constants and the 3x3 MDS, 6.4 KB), and the recursion stack holds at most 20 frames
of a few dozen words.
log2 of that total is 26.188261, submitted as `memory_log2_bytes` = 26.19 (ceiling at
two decimals). f is not live after Step 2 (Section 3). The normalized cost axis is
`time_log2` + max(0, `memory_log2_bytes` - 20) = 34.20 with the submitted bounds; the claim
keeps the two raw bounds separate.

## 10. Limitations and relation to prior entries

The time bound is an operation count of the stated algorithm under the organizer's
prices, not a wall-clock measurement. The executed run used the FLINT library for the
polynomial arithmetic whose results are uniquely defined objects (the polynomial f, the
residue X^p mod q, the gcd and its roots); the half-gcd stage was executed by the counted
program itself on the real instance, so its charge is the instance's executed count. The
transform charges are closed forms validated against an instrumented implementation at
lengths 3..3072 (Appendix A, self-test). The judge does not execute candidate code; the
certificate is the organizer-checked evidence of the outcome, the executed run took a few
minutes with the library arithmetic, and Appendix A reproduces every number from the recorded
sizes, trace histograms and roots. Every kernel self-test, library cross-check and histogram is
participant-produced.

Credits. The univariate root-finding of the lane-0 output with gcd(., X^p - X) and the
deterministic executed-outcome argument were introduced on this board by Th0rgal
(94e9246a); hecmas (a18c0d0a) added round-0 absorption, NTT Barrett powering and a counted
half-gcd; tanctl (b86575d7, b257d730, 0aed4072) introduced the two-round linearizing line
and worst-case fast-gcd accounting. The two-round bypass itself is the trick of Bariant,
Bouvier, Leurent and Perrin (ToSC 2022/3) for SPN CICO problems. What this package adds is
its accounting: closed forms validated against instrumented kernels, no bit-reversal passes,
scaling folded into the pointwise step, the N1-fold remainder, the transiently recomputed
FFT_N1(q), an executed and histogram-reproducible half-gcd, and f discarded after q is formed.

## Appendix A. Program listings

The executed driver (`attack.py`), the instrumented kernels with their closed forms and self-tests
(`ntt.py`, `modsq.py`, `powering.py`), the counted half-gcd and root stage (`halfgcd.py`, `gcd_stage.py`,
`roots.py`), the trace charge (`halfgcd_charge.py`) and the standard-library reproduction (`accounting.py`).
Run `python accounting.py orchard-pallas-constants.json ledger_r2.json <dir with the gcd_trace files>` to recompute
every number of Section 6 and the pair; `python ntt.py`, `python modsq.py`, `python powering.py` run the
kernel self-tests. The ledger and the trace histogram are reproduced verbatim in Appendix B.

### ntt.py

```python
"""ntt.py - instrumented number-theoretic transform over the Pallas field, N = 3*2^k.

Forward = decimation in frequency (radix-2 levels, lengths N, N/2, ..., 6, then one
untwiddled 3-point DFT on each contiguous block of 3).  Inverse = exact reversal
(3-point inverse DFT, then decimation-in-time levels 6, 12, ..., N) and returns N*a.
Outputs of the forward transform are in a fixed permuted order; pointwise products are
order-free, so no bit-reversal permutation exists anywhere.  Twiddles are generated on the
fly by a running product (one multiplication per butterfly), so there is NO twiddle table:
the charge per radix-2 butterfly is 2 mul + 1 add + 1 sub + 1/2 loop = 4.5.

The radix-3 stage is innermost and needs no twiddles, so a radix-3 butterfly is one 3-point DFT
= 1 mul + 7 add/sub + 1/2 loop = 8.5.  T(N) below is the closed form for this algorithm.

Memory traffic: register-blocked passes of three radix-2 levels: (1 load + 1 store)/3 per
element per radix-2 level; the radix-3 level is one pass: 1 load + 1 store per element.
Pass schedule: levels are grouped into passes of three radix-2 levels; the k mod 3 leftover
levels are merged with the radix-3 level into one final pass, so the actual traffic is
2N*(floor(k/3)+1) <= (2/3)Nk + 2N for every k (equality at k = 15 and k = 18).  The
instrumented kernel does not model passes; it charges the closed form per level.
Loop control: a radix-8 pass processes 8 elements = 12 butterflies per iteration (one index
add + one compare + one branch = 3 units per 12 butterflies), so 1/2 per butterfly is
conservative.

T(N) = (N/2)*k*(9/2) + (2/3)*N*k + (N/3)*(17/2) + 2N  =  N*(35/12*k + 29/6),  k = log2(N/3).

### modsq.py

```python
"""modsq.py - counted Barrett modular squaring (wrap trick), Newton inverse, X-multiply.

Loop control: every per-element loop (pointwise, padding, copies, folds, subtraction,
reversal, X-multiply, Newton linear work, cache build) is charged 1/2 unit per element:
loops are unrolled 8 elements per iteration, one index add + one compare + one branch =
3 units per 8 elements, charged as 1/2 per element (conservative).

Polynomials are Python lists (coefficient i at index i) over the Pallas field.  q is monic
of degree D (list of D+1 entries), n = D-1, inv = rev(q)^-1 mod X^n (list of n entries).
N1 = smallest 3*2^k >= D, N2 = smallest 3*2^k >= 2D-1 (= 2*N1 for every D used here).

barrett_square (proof 4.2, S1-S3) on buffers Q (D+1), R (N1: holds a / a2f / rem), A (N2),
cached INVQ (N2, unscaled transform of inv) and optionally QN1 (N1, unscaled transform
of q).  Every store/load/field operation is charged on the Counter; closed forms SQ, NEWTON
and MULX reproduce the instrumented totals exactly (asserted in _selftest).

"""Counted half-gcd over F_p (python-flint arithmetic; every charge an exact Fraction).

Prices (orchard-field-ram-v2): field add/sub/mul, 256-bit load/store, compare/branch, shift/mask: 1 each.
Loop control: 1/2 per inner iteration (loops unrolled 8 per iteration, the convention of proof 4.1).
  T(N)   transform of length N = 3*2^k (ntt.py): N*(35k/12 + 29/6); only these lengths are used.
  transform product of lengths m1, m2, N = nice_length(m1+m2-1):
         3 T(N) + 5 N (pointwise: 2 loads, 2 muls with 1/N folded, 1 store) + 2 (m1+m2) (copy both inputs
         into padded buffers) + (N-m1) + (N-m2) (padding stores) + N/2 (loop control)
  classical product: 4 m1 m2 + m1 m2 / 2 + 2 (m1+m2-1); each product uses the cheaper rule.
  add/sub of length m: 4 m + m/2.   copy/shift/truncate of length m: 2 m + m/2.
  field inversion: 380 (a round-up of the 330-unit ladder for x^(p-2): 254 squarings + 76 multiplications).   monic: 380 + m + m/2.
  division of degree n by degree m, L = n-m+1: the cheaper of
         classical 380 + L (4 (m+1) + 2) + L (m+1)/2 + 2 (n+1) + (n+1)/2
         Newton    newton_inv(L) + product(L, L) + product(L, m+1) + 4 (m+1) + (m+1)/2 + 2 (n+1) + (n+1)/2

LEAN mode (default; proof 5.1, memory-lean execution):
  views: a truncation r >> t handed to a child hgcd is a read-only pointer into the parent's buffer: no
         copy, no charge, no words (the child never writes its inputs; the parent keeps the buffer alive).
  matvec_wrap (R (a, b) with R = cofactor matrix from hgcd on the top part of (a, b)): one cyclic transform
         length N = nice_length(n_h + 1), n_h = deg a - deg R11 = deg of the first output (degree relation,
         asserted at run time together with deg of both outputs < N).  Charge, la/lb input lengths, l_ij the
         lengths of the entries (0 = absent):
           load(l)  = 5/2 min(l,N) + 9/2 max(0, l-N) (fold) + 3/2 max(0, N-l) (pad)       for a and b
           loadR(l) = 7/2 l (load, mul by 1/N, store, loop) + 3/2 (N-l)                    per nonzero entry
           T(N) per transformed input (a, b, each nonzero entry) and per nonzero output row (inverse);
           pointwise per row: 9/2 N for its first term (2 loads, mul, store, loop), 13/2 N for a second
           term (3 loads, mul, add, store, loop).
         Memory: 4 buffers of N words (a^, b^, X, Y) at the peak; the top level frees a, b once copied.
  matmul_shared (S P, 2x2): every entry transformed once at N = nice_length(max_{i,l,j} len S_il + len P_lj - 1)
         (linear, no wrap): P entries loadR, S entries load (5/2 l + 3/2 (N-l)), T(N) each nonzero entry, per
         row an in-place 2x2 pointwise pass 29/2 N (6 loads, 4 mul, 2 add, 2 stores, loop), T(N) per nonzero
         output entry.  Memory: 4 N (P^) + 2 N (one row of S^, overwritten by the row's outputs).
  Each wrapped/shared step is taken only when its charge is below the plain product-by-product charge.
Memory model: live coefficient words of every polynomial owned by an active frame of the recursion plus
transform scratch (2 N words for a transform product, m1+m2-1 for a classical one, (n+1)+L (+2N) for a division,
the buffer counts above for matvec_wrap / matmul_shared).
