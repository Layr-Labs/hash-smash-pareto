# poseidon-orchard-r56: plain birthday search, one trail with distinguished points

Credit: this is the textbook collision search (Pollard rho with distinguished points, van Oorschot-Wiener) applied to the Orchard hash with 56 partial rounds; we add nothing to the mathematics. The accounting (single trail, one table, recovery from stored points) is our own. No other participant's program was used or run. Claim: time_log2 = 127.011, memory below 1 MiB (claimed 2^20 bytes), success probability 0.39. It is a generic attack: no property of the 56 partial rounds is used, and it does not beat the nominal 127 (it is 0.011 above it). Its point is that it exists at every round count; it is the generic row of this round count and uses no algebraic structure.

## 1. Target and relation

Target `poseidon-orchard-r56-prefix-v1`: input two canonical field elements (nk, rho) of the Pallas base field, p = 0x40000000000000000000000000000000224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001 (about 2^254); initial state [nk, rho, 2^65]; the 64 selected rounds (original rounds 0-3 full, 4-59 partial, 60-63 full: 4 full, 56 partial, 4 full; constants and MDS as deployed); digest = state[0], canonical 32-byte little-endian, the complete element compared. Reference unit: one call of the permutation = one target compression; C(56) = 216 + 21 * 56 = 1392 primitive operations.

Walk. Fix rho = 0 and write F(x) = digest(x, 0), a map from the field into the field. Two inputs (x, 0) and (y, 0) with x != y and F(x) = F(y) are a collision of the target; both are canonical encodings, distinct as pairs. The search iterates x_0, x_i = F(x_{i-1}) and returns the pair (x_{mu-1}, x_{mu-1+L}) at the merge point of the trail (Section 3). The output of F is a canonical field element, so it is again an admissible input: no conversion is needed and no operation is spent on one. This is the whole reason the walk is on F itself.

## 2. The program (Appendix B `rho.py`, function `search`; parameters in `plan`)

1. x_0 = a uniformly random 254-bit word (one random word and one AND with 2^254 - 1; every 254-bit word is below p, so no rejection).
2. Loop for i = 1 .. S: x = F(x): first the state is re-initialised to [x, 0, 2^65] (coordinate 1 is x itself, the digest of the previous call, which is the first coordinate of its output state; coordinates 2 and 3 are overwritten by the permutation and are set again to 0 and 2^65: 2 operations, charged, Section 5), then one reference call. If x mod 2^128 < T (T = 27554; exact density theta = (2^126 + 1) T / p = 2^-113.25003, Section 4): x is a distinguished point (DP). The table is looked up by a linear scan of its entry array (Section 6); if the value is already in the table the trail has closed: go to 3. Otherwise store (i, x) (48 bytes: a 32-byte value word and a 16-byte index word). If the table already holds 2^14 DPs, halt (failure). After S steps without a repeated DP, halt (failure).
3. Recovery. The repeated value is x_b = x_a (b = i, a its first stored index), L = b - a. Let (s, x_s) be the stored entry just before the one at index a (the start x_0 at index 0 if there is none). Compute x_{s+L} from the nearest stored point at or before s + L by iterating F (more than gmax steps: halt). If x_s = x_{s+L} halt (start on the cycle). Then iterate both from (x_s, x_{s+L}) in lockstep: the first time F(A) = F(B) return (A, B). More than gmax lockstep rounds: halt.

Every evaluation in the recovery (the walk to x_q, and both walkers of the lockstep) starts with the same re-initialisation of the state. Parameters (integers, `plan`): S = n + d with n = 1.6948e38 (log2 126.9944, a multiple of 2^100), d = ceil(8 / theta) = 9.880e34, gmax = ceil(18 / theta) = 2.2229e35, table 2^14 DPs. `python3 rho.py --plan` (Appendix B saved as rho.py) prints them (Appendix).

## 3. Correctness of the recovery (deterministic)

Let t be the least index with x_t = x_j for some j < t, mu = j (the trail enters its cycle at mu; lambda = t - mu is the cycle length). For i >= mu, x_i = x_{i+lambda}. A repeated DP is found at b = a' + lambda where a' is the first DP with index at least mu: DPs with index in [t, a' + lambda) would repeat values of x_mu .. x_{a'-1}, which hold no DP; so a = a' and L = lambda (a stored value repeats only along the cycle, and the first repeat is at a' + lambda). The stored entry before a is a DP with index < mu (none lies in [mu, a)) or the start; so s < mu <= a, or s = 0 = mu (halt: start on the cycle, x_0 = x_L). With s < mu, x_s != x_{s+L} and the least m >= 1 with x_{s+m} = x_{s+m+L} is m = mu - s <= a - s, so the lockstep stops within a - s rounds and returns (x_{mu-1}, x_{mu-1+L}), which differ and have equal F. The nearest stored point before q = s + L < t exists (x_0). The number of evaluations in the recovery is at most gmax (walk to x_q) + 2 gmax (lockstep) = 3 gmax when every gap between consecutive stored points is at most gmax (the halts).

## 4. Success probability (Lemma 2, for a uniformly random function F)

Model H1 (Section 7): F is a uniformly random function from the N = p field elements to themselves, and the DP set (fixed by the program before the walk) is independent of F. All statements below are theorems for that F; Section 7 declares that the real F behaves so. Only closed-form inequalities are used (1 - x <= e^-x, the union bound, the product inequality of (b), the Chernoff-Hoeffding tail of (c)): no numerical moment-generating-function bound and no distributional law fitted to data; the bound of the last line is evaluated in 80-digit decimal arithmetic by `plan`.

Density. p = 2^254 + c with c = p mod 2^128 = 0x224698fc094cf91b992d30ed00000001 >= T, so exactly theta p = (2^126 + 1) T of the p field elements satisfy x mod 2^128 < T: theta = (2^126 + 1) T / p exactly (2^-113.25003; not T / 2^128). All integers below are exact: n is a multiple of 2^100, d = ceil(8 / theta), gmax = ceil(18 / theta) (integers, as `range` needs).

(a) The trail. Given x_0, .., x_i with no earlier repeat, x_i was never queried, so F(x_i) is uniform: it equals one of the i + 1 earlier values with probability (i + 1) / N. Hence P(t > n) = prod_{i<n} (1 - (i + 1)/N) <= exp(-n (n + 1) / (2N)). The merge value x_t = x_0 (j = 0, the start on the cycle) has probability at most 1/N at each step: at most n / N in all (it gives no collision).
(b) Detection. Given the equality pattern of x_0 .. x_t, the distinct values x_1 .. x_{t-1} are uniform distinct elements (the pattern's probability does not depend on the values), so the DP flags of any m of them are hypergeometric (draws without replacement from p elements of which theta p are distinguished); the probability of no flag is prod_{j<m} (p - theta p - j)/(p - j) <= (1 - theta)^m <= exp(-theta m), since each factor is at most 1 - theta. A DP in the first min(lambda, d) cycle values makes the detection happen by step t + d, so S = n + d suffices. P(no such DP) <= exp(-theta d) + P(lambda < d), and P(lambda < d, t <= n) <= n d / N (at each step t and each lambda < d the probability that x_t = x_{t-lambda} is at most 1/N).
(c) Table. The number of DPs among S distinct fresh values is hypergeometric with mean mu = S theta; Hoeffding (1963, Theorem 4) shows its moment generating function is at most that of Binomial(S, theta), so the Chernoff bound holds: P(more than 2^14) <= exp(-mu) (e mu / 2^14)^(2^14), mu = 13731.7: the logarithm is -241.08 (`plan`, ln_P_table_overflow).
(d) Gaps. For a stored point (a DP or the start), the g fresh values after it contain no DP with probability at most (1 - theta)^g <= exp(-theta g) by the product inequality of (b) (conditionally on the earlier values); the number of DPs among S values has expectation S theta exactly, so the union over the stored points gives (S theta + 1) exp(-theta g); g = gmax: theta gmax >= 18. All positions used by the recovery (s, a, q < t) lie among the first t - 1 distinct values, so (d) covers them.
Total failure probability beyond (a): eps = exp(-8) + n d / N + (S theta + 1) exp(-18) + exp(-100) = 1.1230e-3 (the exp(-100) is the table term, with room). The program's n is the least multiple of 2^100 with 1 - exp(-n (n + 1)/2N) - n/N - eps >= 0.39, decided in 80-digit decimal arithmetic: `plan` gives 0.390000000554332285. So P_F(success) >= 0.39 (the margin is 5.54e-10; Section 7 prices any shortfall of H1).

Single attempt: no restart, no amplification, nothing stored from an earlier run, no advice.

## 5. Operation ledger (unit: target compressions; C = 1392)

Machine. Pallas field RAM with 256-bit words (the profile of `orchard-cost-v2.json`): a call of the reference permutation is 1 unit and pays for all its arithmetic, constants and loads, and nothing else; every other word operation (add, compare, branch, register move, assignment of a constant to a register, load, store) costs 1/1392 (the cost model's `word_operation` weight). The permutation transforms its three-word state in place, so it does not leave the next input behind: the program charges the restoration of the state before every evaluation. Counted by `rho.py` (`ops`, `ledger_ops`; constants W_* in Section 3 of the program), nothing counted twice:

- Trail step (executed at most S times): the call x = F(x): 1 unit. Other operations: W_INIT = 2 (state coordinate 2 := 0, coordinate 3 := 2^65; coordinate 1 already holds x, the output of the previous call); W_LOOP = 7 (step counter add 1, register move of the digest into x 1, AND with the 128-bit mask 1, compare with T 1, branch 1, loop-bound compare 1, branch 1). W_STEP = 9.
- Recovery evaluation (at most 3 gmax: the walk to x_q and the two lockstep walkers): 1 unit and W_INIT + W_RLOOP = 2 + 8 = 10 other operations (the counter, the two register moves, the equality compare and its branch, loop control). W_REC = 10.
- Table lookup: a linear scan of the entry array, W_SCAN = 6 operations per entry examined (load the value word 1, compare 1, branch 1, index add 1, loop-bound compare 1, branch 1). A DP event happens at most 2^14 + 1 times and scans at most 2^14 + 1 entries; insertion W_INS = 3 (store the value word, store the index word, add 1 to the entry count). All of it: (2^14 + 2)(6 (2^14 + 1) + 3) = 1,610,956,818 operations (part of `other_fixed` in `plan`, with the next two items).
- Bisection over the stored indices: at most 15 probes of W_PROBE = 8 operations; the random word, the mask, the constants, the halts and the report: MISC = 2000.

OTHER_FIXED = (2^14 + 2)(6 (2^14 + 1) + 3) + 15 * 8 + 2000 = 1,610,958,938 operations (1.2e+06 units, a deterministic count: no probe or hash bound is needed because there is no hash).

Total: T = S (1 + 9/1392) + 3 gmax (1 + 10/1392) + OTHER_FIXED / 1392 = 1.713499e+38 units, log2 T = 127.01021. Claimed time_log2 = 127.011 (rounded up). Previous version of this entry (POSGEN2, 83c8a1b1): 7 and 8 other operations, 10^8 for the rest, log2 T = 127.00815; the difference is the two state-initialisation operations per evaluation (the judges' F1) and the exact table scan. Preprocessing: none (preprocessing_log2 = 0). The claim is the full budget that achieves 0.39 (every halt charged at its limit), as the cost model requires, not an expected running time. `python3 rho.py --selftest` runs the reduced search and checks that its counted operations stay below the formula for its parameters.

## 6. Memory and the table representation

Representation (every entry the same, nothing else is stored): one array of entries; entry e occupies bytes 48 e .. 48 e + 47: a 32-byte value word (the distinguished value x, a canonical field element) followed by a 16-byte index word (i < 2^128: i <= S < 2^128). Entry 0 is the start x_0 with index 0; entries 1 .. 2^14 are the stored DPs in increasing index order, so the bisection works on the array directly and the entry just before position k is entry k - 1. There is no hash table, no separate lookup index, no pointer and no per-entry metadata: lookup is the linear scan of Section 5 (6 operations per entry), insert is two stores at the end of the array plus the count. The Python program `rho.py` keeps the same array (`pts`, a list of (index, value) pairs) and the same scan (`lookup`); it has no dictionary. The array has at most 2^14 + 1 entries; 2^14 + 2 are reserved (one spare).

Memory: table 2^14 + 2 entries of 48 bytes: 786,528. Code and constants: the permutation (a loop over 64 rounds, at most 150 instructions), the search with the scan, the recovery: at most 600 instructions at 36 bytes (256-bit immediates in the instruction word): 21,600; round constants 192 * 32 + MDS 9 * 32 + capacity 32: 6,464; registers (at most 16 words): 512. Sum 815,104 bytes <= 2^20 = 1,048,576. Claimed 2^20, so the memory term of the score is 0. The scan needs no scratch memory beyond the registers.

## 7. Premises (declared)

H1 (score-critical; claim.json `H1-random-function-model`): on the walk x -> digest(x, 0) the single attempt succeeds with probability at least P_F of Section 4 (F uniformly random, DP flags independent of the collision events). Scope: this target, the inputs (x, 0), one trail of about 1.7e38 evaluations from a uniform 254-bit start. This is an assumption, and no proof is known: the Orchard permutation at 56 partial rounds is not known to have any structure that lowers the collision hazard of a walk of 2^127 steps, but absence of known structure is not evidence of the exact one-sided transfer from a random function to this fixed map. The probability is over the algorithm's fresh coin (the 254-bit start x_0, one random word, charged in MISC) and the random function; nothing is estimated from sampling. Nothing else in the claim is heuristic: Lemma 2, the recovery correctness and every count are proved in Sections 3 to 6.

Evidence, stated plainly. No trusted evidence for H1 exists: the organizer's experiment runner cannot run Poseidon experiments (Section 8), so no experiment is declared and the organizer execution record is empty. Our own checks (width-14 search on the real digest, and 64 points of the full-width walk with a low-10-bit projection) were run outside the organizer runner; they are untrusted and descriptive: they show that the program runs and that every returned pair is verified by the organizer digest, they reach neither the 254-bit event nor 2^127 evaluations, and no number of the claim is estimated from them.

Sensitivity of the budget to H1: if the hazard of a fresh step is (1 - e) / N instead of 1 / N, the budget needs a factor (1 - e)^(-1/2) in n: 0.0072 bit for e = 0.01, 0.0370 bit for e = 0.05, 0.076 bit for e = 0.10. The bound has no probability margin above 0.39 (n is the least multiple of 2^100), so any deficit is repaired by extra time at these prices.

H2 (supporting; `H2-machine-convention`): the reference permutation call is one unit and pays for its arithmetic, constants and loads, and not for the state restoration or the loop, which are charged as in Section 5 (the cost model's `word_operation`); loop variables are registers; code is 36 bytes per instruction. Sensitivity: each further operation per trail step adds 1/1392 unit per step = 1.03e-03 bit; if a step cost 20 other operations instead of 9 the time would rise by 0.0113 bit.

H3 (supporting; `H3-table-representation`): the table is the array of Section 6 with the linear-scan lookup of Section 5; it is a concrete layout, and its time and memory are counted from it, not assumed. What is assumed is only the machine reading that an array access with an index held in a register is one load.

## 8. Experiments

None are declared, and none can be: the organizer experiment runner's python path calls its digest callback on the empty message to size the digest (`runner.py`, `_python_result`: `digest_fn(b"")`), which the Poseidon target rejects (it accepts exactly two 32-byte little-endian canonical field encodings and raises `PoseidonInputError` otherwise), so every Poseidon package that declares a message-pair experiment is rejected at intake before its program runs; this happened to our earlier filing 98b1c2c4, with the pair of 64-byte messages (x, 0) already canonical. The program is therefore printed in Appendix B and the trusted experiment report is `not_requested` by necessity. We checked the program ourselves against the organizer digest at r = 56 (equal on every vector tried) and checked every returned pair of its small self-check runs: each is two 64-byte messages (x, 0) of canonical 32-byte little-endian encodings, distinct, and the digests agree on the stated bits. These checks are untrusted program checks, not experiments of the claim.
