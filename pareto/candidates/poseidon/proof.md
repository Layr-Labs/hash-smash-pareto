# Orchard Poseidon r=23: generic distinguished-point rho with the 412-operation equivalent-form step, filed at the tight random-function budget — normalized cost 126.24613

## 1. The claim

Target `poseidon-orchard-r23-prefix-v1` (Orchard P128Pow5T3 over Pallas, full rounds 0-3 and 60-63, twenty-three partial rounds 4..26, state `[m0, m1, 2^65]`, digest = state[0], complete element compared). Output: two distinct 64-byte canonical messages with equal digests. Cost model `orchard-field-ram-v2`: `C(23) = 216 + 21 * 23 = 699` primitive operations per target compression; one canonical field addition or multiplication, or one primitive 256-bit word operation, costs `1/699` unit.

* `time_log2 = 126.24613` target-compressions: `N_max = 70,525,774,044,091,932,409,858,330,149,005,493,979,386` primitive operations (Section 7), `log2(N_max / 699) = 126.24612574508014`, rounded up at five decimals. Every halt is charged at its limit; the offline derivation of the constants and parameters (Section 9) is bounded by `186,527,993,160` word operations, inside `N_max`, and declared as `preprocessing_log2 = 28` (one quantity, not added twice).
* `memory_log2_bytes = 20`: the reviewed total is `1,044,180` bytes, below `2^20 = 1,048,576` (Section 8); the normalized memory penalty is zero. Normalized cost `126.24613 + max(0, 20 - 20) = 126.24613`.
* `success_probability = 0.39`: Lemma 2 (Section 5) proves `0.39000000244948219830 >= 0.39` for a uniformly random function at the filed budget, in exact integer arithmetic; the transfer to the real map is the single premise H1 (Section 6).
* `nonuniform_advice_log2_bytes = 0`: no stored collision, no precomputed advice; the coins `rho0` and `x_0` are drawn by the attempt itself.
* Baseline recorded: `poseidon-orchard-r23-nominal-v2` (nominal 127; not a claim of beating a qualified baseline). This entry improves on our own r=23 entry `a5a40e52` (126.26274, in review) by 0.0166 bits and on the r=23 incumbent `ab786fcb` (126.74586) by 0.4997 bits.

**Credits.** The step program (Section 3), the search and recovery (Section 4), the success lemma and the filed budget (Sections 5-6), the ledger and memory conventions (Sections 7-9) are those of the r=24 entry `bf6d2b58` (Jbenisek, in review), re-derived here at r=23 with its program `rho.py` (Appendix A, standard library only) executed unchanged except for the partial-round count. Its 424-operation step at r=24 becomes `412 = 136 + 12 * 23` here; its budget (`n = 133566495 * 2^100`, `T_DP = 49780`, `MCAP = 25553`, `gmax = 135016408443598012162521064303628701`) is round-independent and is filed verbatim. The line and walk map are those of the r=23 incumbent `ab786fcb` and of our entry `a5a40e52`; the measured-hazard evidence is the 16,380-walk campaign of `a5a40e52` on the bit-identical r=23 map (Section 6).

## 2. Target, line and walk

Round 0 maps `(m0, m1)` bijectively to `U = (m0 + c_{0,0})^5`, `V = (m1 + c_{0,1})^5` (gcd(5, p-1) = 1), the third lane is the constant `K = (2^65 + c_{0,2})^5`, and the round-1 S-box inputs are affine in `(U, V)`. On the line `(U, V) = (U0 + a tau, V0 + b tau)` with `a = MDS[0][1]`, `b = -MDS[0][0]`, lane 0 of that input is constant and lanes 1, 2 are `d_1 tau`, `d_2 tau`; with `W = tau^5` the state after round 1 is `A + W B` for two constant vectors. `message(W)` inverts the line injectively (fifth roots, `INV5 = 5^-1 mod (p-1)`).

The attempt draws two coins, `rho0` and `x_0`, each the low 254 bits of a uniformly random 256-bit word, and iterates `F(x) = digest(message(x + rho0)) / OUTSCALE`, `x_i = F(x_{i-1})`, where `OUTSCALE` is a fixed nonzero field constant of the program. Two values `x != y` with `F(x) = F(y)` give `W = x + rho0 != W' = y + rho0`, hence two distinct 64-byte messages with equal digests: a collision of the target.

## 3. The step program: the hash in an equivalent form (412 field operations)

One evaluation of `F` is the straight-line program `STEP` (Appendix B, printed by `python3 rho.py --listing`): `412 = 136 + 12 * 23` operations, 165 ADD and 247 MUL, all canonical Pallas field operations on 256-bit registers. It computes the same field element as the reference rounds 2-63 applied to `A + (x + rho0) B`, divided by `OUTSCALE`:

* **Lane scaling.** A lane may be held as its true value divided by a known nonzero constant `lambda`; an S-box then gives `(true)^5 = lambda^5 (held)^5`, and `lambda^5` is folded into the constants of the next linear layer. A linear combination `sum_j g_j z_j + c` is held divided by `g_0`, which makes one coefficient 1: 2 MUL + 2 ADD (+ 1 ADD for a round constant) per lane instead of 3 MUL + 2 ADD (+ 1).
* **Partial rounds.** Lane 0 is held as `lambda h0 + gamma` and lanes 1, 2 as `Q (h1, h2) + q`. The hidden pair is held in the basis `Pm = diag(nu) M22^23` (`M22` the lower 2x2 block of `MDS`), `nu_a` making the coefficient of `Z0` in `h_a` equal to 1; each partial round multiplies `Q` by `M22`, so after the 23 partial rounds `Q = M22^23 Pm^-1 = diag(nu)^-1` is diagonal and the exit costs one ADD per lane. A partial round is `x5 = (h0 + kappa)^5`, `h0 := x5 + n1 h1 + n2 h2`, `h1 := h1 + w1 x5`, `h2 := h2 + w2 x5`: 12 operations (1 ADD, 3 MUL for the S-box, 4 MUL, 4 ADD), the five constants offline.
* **Counts.** Entry `x + e_i` (3 ADD, `e_i = E0_i + rho0` set once per attempt); round 2: S-boxes 9 MUL, linear layer with the round-3 constants 6 MUL + 9 ADD; round 3: S-boxes 9 MUL, linear layer into the partial-round form 6 MUL + 6 ADD; 23 partial rounds, 12 each; round-60 S-box inputs from the partial-round form 3 ADD (`Q` diagonal); rounds 60, 61, 62: 9 MUL + 6 MUL + 9 ADD each; round 63: S-boxes 9 MUL, output lane 0 only, 2 MUL + 2 ADD. Sum `3 + 24 + 21 + 276 + 3 + 72 + 13 = 412`. An S-box `x^5` is 3 MUL (square, square, multiply).
* **Constants.** `build_step` derives all 162 step constants from the deployed round constants and `MDS`, and asserts that every scale, pivot and `Q` is nonzero or invertible. `OUTSCALE` is the scale of the output lane.
* **Checks** (`python3 rho.py --selftest`): the line identity at 3 points; the step program equals `digest(message(x + rho0)) * OUTINV` at 6 random `(x, rho0)`; `len(STEP) == 136 + 12 * 23`; 24 mini searches at width 14 with the real step program, every one inside the ledger bound (largest counted ledger 122,930 at its parameters). Cross-checks run for this entry: the program's `digest` equals the organizer's `verifier/poseidon.py` digest at `rounds = 23` on 24 of 24 random canonical pairs, and `F(x) * OUTSCALE` equals that digest of `message(x + rho0)` on 8 of 8 random `(x, rho0)`.

## 4. The search (Appendix A `rho.py`: `attack`, `search`, `plan`)

1. **Setup:** coins `rho0`, `x_0` (two random words); the 162 step constants are loaded once into their registers (162 loads); `e_i = E0_i + rho0` (3 ADD); the table and side array are initialised.
2. **Trail**, in blocks of 8 unrolled steps: for each slot `k`: `x := F(x)` (the step program, in place); if `x mod 2^128 < T_DP` (`T_DP = 49780`), `x` is a distinguished point (DP) with index `i + k + 1`: the table is scanned; if `x` is stored the trail has closed (go to 3); if the table holds `MCAP = 25553` DPs, halt (failure); else store `(x, index)`. After the block `i := i + 8`; after `S` steps, halt (failure).
3. **Recovery.** The repeat is `x_b = x_a` (`b` the current index, `a` the stored one), `L = b - a`. With `(s, x_s)` the entry stored just before `a` (the start at index 0 if none), `x_{s+L}` is computed from the nearest stored point at or before `s + L` (bisection on the stored indices, then at most `gmax` evaluations), then both walkers iterate in lockstep from `(x_s, x_{s+L})`; the first `F(A) = F(B)` returns `(A, B)`. The output is the two messages `message(A + rho0)`, `message(B + rho0)` (three fifth roots each).

No exponential, root, division or parameter search is executed by the attempt: `S` and `gmax` are the integer literals `STEPS` and `GMAXC` of the program, derived offline and asserted by `plan`.

**Parameters** (`python3 rho.py --plan`, round-independent except the step and `C`): `S = n + d = 169,380,592,158,660,633,169,079,816,392,825,298,528` (a multiple of 8), `n = 169,315,647,557,130,801,213,862,401,197,337,477,120 = 133,566,495 * 2^100` (log2 126.9930), `d = 64,944,601,529,831,955,217,415,195,487,821,408`, `gmax = 135,016,408,443,598,012,162,521,064,303,628,701`, `T_DP = 49780`, `MCAP = 25553`, `KD = 19/2`, `H = 79/4`, `TAB = 12`.

## 5. Success probability for a uniformly random function

In this section `F` is a uniformly random function on the `N = p` field elements (lazy sampling) and `x_0` is any fixed element. `D = (2^126 + 1) T_DP` is the exact number of DPs in the field, `theta = D / N = 2^-112.39672`, `theta_lo = (D - 2^128) / N`, `theta_hi = D / (N - 2^128)`; every index used is below `SMAX = 2^128 < S`.

*Lemma 1.* (i) Given `x_0 .. x_i` with no repeat, `x_{i+1}` is uniform, so it repeats one of the `i + 1` earlier values with probability `(i+1) / N`. (ii) Given `x_0`, `t`, `mu` and `x_1 .. x_{j-1}`, the value `x_j` is uniform over the `N - j` unused elements, of which `D - k` are DPs (`k <= j` DPs among the used): `theta_lo <= P(x_j is a DP | history) <= theta_hi`. Both bounds condition on the whole history, so they apply after a stored point.

*Lemma 2* (the filed budget). With `n`, `d >= KD / theta_lo` (`d` rounded up to a multiple of 8), `gmax = ceil(H / theta_lo)`, `S = n + d`, `MCAP = 25553` and the search of Section 4, the attempt on a uniformly random function succeeds with probability at least:
`1 - exp(-n (n+1) / 2N) - n / N - eps`, `eps = e^-KD + n d / N + (S theta_hi + 1) e^-H + e^-TAB = 5.2644e-04`,
which `plan` evaluates in exact integer arithmetic (every term rounded in the safe direction; the only transcendental objects are the two fixed-point series `e^-x`, 101 and 48 terms) as
`0.39000000244948219830 >= 0.39`.
The terms: (a) trail, `P(t > n) = prod_{i<n} (1 - (i+1)/N) <= exp(-n(n+1)/2N)` and the start on the cycle at most `n / N`; (b) detection, given `t <= n`, `mu` and `lambda >= d`, no DP among `x_mu .. x_{mu+d-1}` with probability at most `(1 - theta_lo)^d <= e^-KD`, and `P(lambda < d, t <= n) <= n d / N`; (c) table, the stored DPs below `t` are dominated by `Binomial(S, theta_hi)`, mean `24,778.73 < MCAP + 1`, so `P(table overflow) <= e^-12.00 <= e^-TAB`; (d) gaps, a stored point followed by `gmax` positions without DP at most `(S theta_hi + 1) e^-H`. One attempt: no restart, no amplification. `n = 133,566,495 * 2^100` is the least multiple of `2^100` that reaches 0.39.

## 6. Premise H1 and its evidence

**H1** (`claim.json` heuristic `H1-random-function-model`, score-critical, the only premise). For the attempt's coins `rho0` and `x_0` (uniform 254-bit words), the search of Section 4 on the real map `F(x) = digest(message(x + rho0)) / OUTSCALE`, at the filed budget `n = 133,566,495 * 2^100` trail steps, succeeds with probability at least 0.39. H1 is our theory that, for this search, the fixed map with a random `rho0` behaves like a uniformly random function. Scope: this target, this line, this budget; only the success probability rests on it (the step program, the recovery, the ledger and the memory are proved or counted exactly).

Evidence, all on the real map family of this entry:
(i) The declared organizer-run experiment `lowbits-birthday` (Section 10): the first 14 bits of this target's own digest agree for a returned pair in every trial, as a random 14-bit function would (about 160 inputs on average; at most 1200 per trial).
(ii) The 16,380-walk measurement campaign of our r=23 entry `a5a40e52` (its Appendix C): first-repeat walks on the truncated r=23 map at widths 16..36 with fresh `(rho, start)` per walk, exact discrete first-repeat likelihood; the pooled collision hazard multiplier is 1.0044 with profile-likelihood 95% interval [0.9891, 1.0198] — indistinguishable from the random-function model at every width. That campaign walked the map through the 419.75-operation sparse step form; the map is bit-identical to this entry's (both forms compute `digest(message(x + rho0)) / OUTSCALE`; the organizer-verifier cross-check of Section 3 runs on this entry's form, 24 of 24), so the measurements are measurements of this entry's map.
(iii) The r=7/23/56 truncated-output campaigns of the dependency `bf6d2b58` (its Appendices D-F), which support the same model at neighbouring round counts.

## 7. Ledger (unit: target compressions; every operation 1/699)

Machine: the Pallas field RAM of `orchard-cost-v2.json` with 256-bit words and a declared file of 223 registers (counted in memory, Section 8). Prices: canonical field ADD and MUL `1/699` each; every other primitive word operation (AND, OR, shift, compare, branch, register move, aligned 256-bit load or store, random word) `1/699`. No reference permutation is called: every evaluation of `F` executes the 412 operations of `STEP`.

* Trail, one block of 8 steps: each step is the 412-operation `STEP` plus its 3-operation DP test (AND, CMPLT, BR), and the block tail (ADD `i`, CMPLT, BR) adds 3 per block, that is `3 / 8` per step — **415.375 operations per trail step**.
* Recovery evaluation: `412 + W_REC` with `W_REC = 6`: the walk and lockstep control around each step (Section 4); at most `3 gmax` evaluations.
* DP handler 6, table scan 19 (12 at the low-part check), insertion 16 (14 executed), bisection probe 13 (12 executed): `OTHER_FIXED = (MCAP + 1)(6 + 19 MCAP + 16) + 16 * 13 + 2,276 (message roots) + 162 (constant loads) + 4 * 1,598 (side zero fill) + 2,000 (coins, masks, bounds, halts, report) = 12,407,219,109` operations.
* Preprocessing: `PREP_OPS = 186,527,993,160` word operations (Section 9), declared `preprocessing_log2 = 28`; a fraction `2^-98` of the total, inside `time_log2` and not added twice.

Total, every halt charged at its limit:
`T = [S (412 + 3) + (S / 8) 3 + 3 gmax (412 + 6) + OTHER_FIXED + PREP_OPS] / 699`
`= 70,525,774,044,091,932,409,858,330,149,005,493,979,386 / 699 = 1.0089524e38` units,
`log2 T = 126.24612574508014`, claimed `time_log2 = 126.24613` (rounded up at five decimals; `python3 rho.py --selftest` checks that the counted operations of its mini searches stay below this formula at their parameters).

## 8. Memory and the table

The table is one array of 32-byte entries: entry `k >= 1` is `(x AND HI) OR index`, the high 126 bits of the DP value with its index in the low half; the low half is below `T_DP < 2^16` and is kept in a side array of 16 fields of 16 bits per word. Entries are in increasing index order (the bisection runs on the array); a lookup compares the high part and then the low part, so it is exact. Nothing else is stored.

Bytes at the peak (the search phase; setup holds a subset): entries `(MCAP + 1) * 32 = 817,728`; side array `1,598 * 32 = 51,136`; start word 32; code at most 4,517 instructions at 36 bytes = 162,612 (8 unrolled trail step copies of `STEP` and one recovery copy, the 162 constant loads, at most 600 other instructions); constants in memory 5,536 (step constants, `E0`, line constants, `INV5`, `OUTSCALE`); register file `223 * 32 = 7,136`. Total `1,044,180 <= 2^20`: the normalized memory penalty is zero, `memory_log2_bytes = 20`.

## 9. Preprocessing (inside time)

Everything the attempt loads or compares with is fixed before it starts: `INV5 = 5^-1 mod (p-1)`; the line constants; the 162 step constants, `E0` and `OUTSCALE` (`build_step`, `line`, `message`); the parameter literals `T_DP`, `MCAP`, `KD`, `H`, `TAB`, `STEPS`, `GMAXC` (`tune`, exact integer and fixed-point arithmetic, no float). The metered bound of the shipped code: `(i)-(iii)` 36,521 field operations charged 8 each plus `2^16` for `INV5` = 357,704; `(iv)` `python3 tune.py rho.py` 185,372,578,816; one run of `plan` 1,154,991,104; loading 65,536. Total `PREP_OPS = 186,527,993,160` word operations `= 2^27.99` target-compressions after division by `C(23) = 699`, declared `preprocessing_log2 = 28`. It is the integer literal `PREP_OPS` of the program, added to the ledger total of Section 7 (inside `time_log2`), and is not added a second time. The measurement campaign cited in Section 6 is evidence for H1, not preprocessing of this entry: it is not run by the attempt and not charged.

## 10. Organizer experiment (declared in `experiments/manifest.json`)

`lowbits-birthday` (`experiments/exp_lowbits.py`, kind `python-message-pairs-v1`, event `digest-xor-mask` with mask `fffc...0` and expected value zero): for each organizer trial the program searches at most 1200 fresh inputs derived from the trial seed for two distinct canonical messages whose digests of the selected target `poseidon-orchard-r23-prefix-v1` agree in the first 14 bits of the big-endian reading, and returns the pair (or two nulls). The program is round-parameterized from the intake request (its `rounds` is parsed from the target profile) and is the file of the dependency `bf6d2b58` unchanged. A returned pair counts only when the organizer's callback digest agrees on those bits. Prediction: a pair in every trial, as a random 14-bit function would (about 160 inputs on average). No full collision is expected or claimed.

## 11. Verification

* `python3 rho.py --selftest` (this entry, this machine): `{"step_ops": 412, "line_affine": true, "step_equals_reference": 6, "rho_n14_pairs": 19, "of": 24, "largest_counted_ops": 122930}` — the step equals the reference digest divided by `OUTSCALE` at 6 random `(x, rho0)`, the line identity holds, and all 24 width-14 mini searches stay inside the ledger bound (largest counted ledger 122,930 at their parameters).
* `python3 rho.py --plan` prints the filed parameters and the ledger and asserts: `STEPS` and `GMAXC` equal their derivation, the success bound `0.3900000024494822 >= 0.39` in exact integer arithmetic, `total_ops = 70,525,774,044,091,932,409,858,330,149,005,493,979,386`, `time_log2 = 126.24613` at five decimals, and the memory total `1,044,180 <= 2^20`.
* Cross-checks against the organizer's verifier (this machine, seed 20261019): the program's `digest` equals `verifier/poseidon.py` at `rounds = 23` on 24 of 24 random canonical pairs; `F(x) * OUTSCALE` equals the organizer digest of `message(x + rho0)` on 8 of 8 random `(x, rho0)`.

## Appendix C: the measured-hazard campaign (cited)

The H1 evidence of Section 6(ii) is the 16,380-walk campaign of our r=23 entry `a5a40e52` (its Appendix C: `measure2.py`, `analysis.py`): first-repeat walks on the truncated r=23 map at widths 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, fresh `(rho, start)` per walk, 8-way chunked, exact discrete first-repeat likelihood with bounded series tail, profile-likelihood intervals per width and pooled. Pooled collision hazard multiplier 1.0044, profile-likelihood 95% interval [0.9891, 1.0198]. The campaign walked the map through the 419.75-operation sparse step form of that entry; the map values are bit-identical to this entry's 412-operation form (both compute `digest(message(x + rho0)) / OUTSCALE`; Section 3 checks this entry's form against the organizer verifier, 24 of 24), so those are measurements of this entry's map. The sources are printed in full in that entry and are not repeated here; this entry runs no new measurement campaign and charges none.
