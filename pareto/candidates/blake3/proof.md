# blake3-r3: plain birthday with seven packed lanes and distinguished points

No differential, no structure of the 3-round compression is used. The claim is the price of the birthday attack on the complete
3-round hash when the compression is evaluated seven instances at a time in 256-bit words and every operation is counted.

## 1. Target and relation

Target `blake3-r3-prefix-v1`. For a 256-bit integer x let M(x) be the 64-byte message `0^32 || x` (x little endian). It is one chunk
with one block, so the complete hash is the root compression of that block: chaining value IV, words m0..m7 = 0, m8..m15 = the eight
little-endian words of x, counter 0, block length 64, flags 11 = CHUNK_START|CHUNK_END|ROOT, rounds 0..2, feed-forward v[i] XOR v[i+8]
for i < 8, digest = the 8 words, little endian (this is `verifier/blake3.py:blake3(M(x), 3)`). Write f(x) for the digest read as a 256-bit
little-endian integer. The attack outputs x != y with f(x) = f(y); then M(x) != M(y) are two distinct messages in the domain with equal
256-bit digests. The program checks the scalar digest `f_scalar` (section 1 of the program) against the organizer reference on 2000
messages and rounds 1..7, and the 7-, 2- and 1-round digests of the 64-byte block against the organizer test vectors (`tests/fixtures/blake3-vectors.json`).

## 2. The attack (program `experiments/rho.py`, sections 3 and 4)

Parameters for n = 256: theta = 2^-114, N = 2^256, L = 2^114, seven lanes. One fresh uniform 256-bit word r (one operation).
Trail t (t = 0, 1, 2, ...) starts at s_t = r + t mod 2^256 and follows x -> f(x) until a distinguished point (DP): a value whose low 114 bits are zero.
1. Seven trails run in the seven lanes of the circuit of section 3. A batch is one evaluation of all seven lanes. Batch counter b = 0, 1, ...
2. After each batch: filter on digest word 0 of all seven lanes (4 operations, section 3.3). If no lane has word 0 = 0, continue with the digests as the next inputs.
3. If some lane has word 0 = 0 (a stage-2 event): for each lane test the other 82 bits. A lane at a DP ends its trail: key = (value >> 114) mod 2^64,
   length = batches since the trail started. If the key is in the table, go to 5. Otherwise store (t, length) under the key, start trail t' = next index in that lane.
4. At every multiple of S = 2^48 batches: a lane whose trail has age >= c = 12 * 2^114 batches is restarted with a new index (a cut trail).
   The search halts (failure) after B batches, after E2 stage-2 events, when the table holds 18,432 keys, or if step 5 finds no pair.
5. Recovery. The two trails have lengths l1 >= l2. Advance the first from its start by l1 - l2 steps, then step both together; at the first step
   with f(a) = f(b) and a != b output (a, b). Both lanes of one circuit are used. At most capr = c + S batches are run.
Constants: B = 48,556,072,151,761,189,409,716,612,589,674,249,048 (= 0.99885 * 2^128 / 7, rounded up), E2 = 158,274,781,453,576,090,684,168,174,986,
table capacity 18,432 entries of 32 bytes. Every one of these is computed by `plan(256)` of the program from the stated formulas.
Per attempt: one fresh r; no restart, no amplification, no stored collision, no advice (K = 0).

## 3. Operation ledger

### 3.1 Machine
Classical load/store machine with 256-bit words and 64 registers, as in the cost model's word RAM; constants are immediates. Charged: every
addition, AND, OR, XOR, shift, comparison, conditional branch, and the one random word. Memory traffic would be charged too, but the inner loop has none:
the 16 state words, the 8 message words and at most 8 temporaries are registers (the digest registers of a batch are the input registers of the next copy of
the unrolled body). The organizer's own count of the reference compression, C(r3) = 638 (`scripts/reference_operation_costs.py` extended to 3 rounds; 222, 430 and 638 for 1, 2
and 3 rounds) also excludes loads and stores. Unit = 638 operations.

### 3.2 One batch = 595 operations
Lane layout: 36-bit lanes (32 data bits, 4 guard bits), 7 lanes per word. A lane value stays below 2^36 (the tracer keeps the bound of every value
and inserts an AND with 0xFFFFFFFF per lane before any sum that could reach 2^36). Sums of packed words are exact because no lane carries out of 36 bits.
XOR is bitwise. Rotation of a lane by r (valid for lane values below 2^36, guard bits arbitrary): ((t >> r) AND A_r) OR ((t << (32-r)) AND B_r), A_r keeping bits
0..31-r and B_r keeping bits 32-r..31 of every lane. Check: the right shift brings bits r..35 of a lane down to 0..35-r and bits 0..r-1 of the next lane to
36-r..35, outside A_r; the left shift puts bit j of a lane at j+32-r, bits j < r land in 32-r..31 (kept) and bits j >= r land at 32 or above, in a position that is
either above bit 31 of the same lane or at 28-r..31-r of the next lane, below 32-r (not kept). So 5 operations (shr, and, shl, and, or) and no mask before the XOR is needed.
Constants (same in every lane) are folded at build time and cost nothing: the four column calls of round 0 depend only on m0..m7 = 0 and IV, so only the four diagonal calls of round 0 and
all calls of rounds 1 and 2 contain variable words. Sums of constants are folded; a XOR with the constant 0 is dropped.
Hand count: a call whose state words are constants and whose two message words are variable costs 5 adds, 4 XORs and 4 rotations of 5 = 29 (round 0, diagonal calls: 4 x 29 = 116);
a call with variable state costs 6 adds, 4 XORs, 20 = 30, and a zero message word (words m0..m7) saves its add: round 1 = 8 x 30 - 8 = 232, round 2 = 232 plus 3 masks (the tracer inserts an AND before a sum that
could reach 2^36) = 235; the 8 digest XORs and 4 masks (words that are not clean) = 12. The tracer (`build_hash`, printed by `python3 rho.py --selftest`) emits exactly these: 116 + 232 + 235 + 12 =
595 = 100 add + 88 xor + 80 shr + 80 shl + 80 or + 167 and. The packed circuit agrees with the scalar digest (selftest, 70 inputs, and in every run of the experiment and of T3 below).
Cost per instance: 595/7 = 85 operations = 0.1332 unit, against 1 unit for a compression.

### 3.3 Filter, loop, and the other events
Filter on digest word 0 of the seven lanes (clean values): t = w0 + 0xFFFFFFFF in every lane (add); u = t AND (bit 32 of every lane) (and); compare u with the all-lanes pattern (compare); branch.
Bit 32 of a lane is set iff the lane's word 0 is nonzero, and sums stay below 2^33. 4 operations per batch. The loop body is the batch repeated 16 times (unrolled, 16 * (595 + 4) = 9,584) plus
counter increment, compare and branch (3): 9,587 operations per 16 batches.
Upper bounds charged per event: stage-2 event 300 operations (7 lanes: shift, AND, compare, branch, plus the word 1..3 tests of a hit lane), finished trail 700 (extract 8 words, key,
scan of at most 18,432 table keys at 3 operations each is charged separately below, write entry, new start: add, 8 word splits and 8 lane insertions), slice check (every 2^48 batches) 100, recovery batch 595 + 24 + 1.
Initial constant folding and setup 2,000.

### 3.4 Total
All counts are upper bounds enforced by halts (section 2, step 4).
| item | bound (operations) |
| --- | --- |
| main loop: B * 9,587 / 16 | 58,188,382,964,866,815,358,869,145,612,150,878,202,897 / 2 (= 2.909419e40) |

| total | 2.924871e40 operations |
Total / 638 = 4.58444e37 units = 2^125.10808. Claim `time_log2` = 125.1081 (rounded up). The main loop is 99.47 percent of it, recovery 0.53 percent.
`python3 rho.py --ledger` prints the exact integers. The random word counts 1 operation and is inside the setup bound.

## 4. Success probability

Heuristic H1 (premise, section 5): f behaves as a random mapping on N = 2^256 points for the points the search evaluates: for every set of distinct inputs, the outputs are
uniform and independent, and whether a value is a DP is an independent event of probability 2^-114. Then (sub-claims proved here, Lemma 2 is a computation under H1):

Lemma 1. A pair x != y of evaluated inputs on two different finished trails with f(x) = f(y) is output: both trails continue identically from f(x), so they end at the same DP with the same key and
the stored lengths let step 5 align and walk them; it returns the first merge pair, found within max(l1, l2) <= capr batches (a trail is cut once its age is >= c, and ages grow by at most S between checks).
A pair inside one trail makes a cycle with no DP (the trail is then cut). A 64-bit key match without a merge ends the run (failure, cost bounded by one recovery).

Lemma 2. Let U be the number of evaluations on trails finished before the halt. The number of evaluations is Q = 7B = 0.99885 * 2^128. The unfinished trails hold at most 7 ages, each
exponential with mean L (memoryless DP), so their sum exceeds 28 L with probability e^-28 * sum_{j<7} 28^j/j! = 5.8e-7. Cut trails cost at most c = 12 L each; their expected loss is
below 7.4e-5 Q, charged as 1.5e-4 Q. Hence U >= 0.99985 Q - 28 L - 1 = 0.99700 * 2^128 except with probability 6e-7 (plus about 4.5e-5 from the discrete number of cut trails). For U distinct inputs the probability of no colliding pair is
prod (1 - i/N) <= exp(-U(U-1)/(2N)) <= exp(-0.497). The expected number of colliding pairs inside a single trail is at most Q L / N = 2^-14.0. The expected number of 64-bit key false matches is below 2^-36.
The losses add to 6e-7 + 6.1e-5 + 4.5e-5 + 3e-11 < 1.2e-4, so P(success) >= 1 - e^-0.497 - 1.2e-4 = 0.3915 >= 0.39. The 0.0015 left over is kept as margin.
If the real pair-collision rate is (1 - eps) of the model, P stays at least 0.39 for eps <= 0.0047, and in general at most 0.5 * log2(1/(1-eps)) more bits of time restore 0.39: 0.0072 for eps = 0.01, 0.037 for 0.05, 0.076 for 0.10, 0.21 for 0.25.

## 5. Premise H1 and its evidence

H1 has three parts: (a) f has no collision structure at the scales used (the pair-collision rate of the evaluated inputs is 2^-256 per pair); (b) the iterates of f from the starts r + t
have the first-collision law of a random mapping; (c) the DP indicator is independent of the collision events. Parts (a) and (b) are premises on the fixed function f, K = 0, and cannot be tested at width 256. What was run (frozen
protocol written before the runs (sources and outputs kept with the entry), no run repeated):
T1 (family law, 3 rounds, fresh random 256-bit K per run, chain truncated to n bits): n = 32, 2000 runs: mean first-repeat time / sqrt(pi N/2) = 1.0075 (z 0.64), E[T^2]/2N = 1.020 (z 0.88), KS 0.78; n = 40, 300 runs: ratio 0.9712 (z -0.95), E[T^2]/2N = 0.977 (z -0.41), KS 1.36 (0.1 percent critical value 1.949). Pass.
T2 (the fixed K = 0 function at full width 256, 2^26 points per statistic, observed equal pairs of a projection against C(2^26,2)/2^bits; sources: iterates of f from a random start, inputs r + i, uniform inputs; 14 projections each): 42 statistics (3 sources x 14 projections): observed/expected between 0.9546 and 1.0342, z between -2.29 and 1.55 (largest |z| 2.29 against the bound 4.5), mean z -0.46. Pass.
T3 (the shipped search, plan(n), one attempt per fresh r, on the target chain K = 0 and on an ideal function of the same width): n = 32 (d = 8, Q = 72,527 evaluations, pure-birthday value 0.458), 4000 attempts each: target 1772 successes (0.443), ideal 1814 (0.4535), two-proportion z = -0.94; n = 40 (d = 12, Q = 1,160,292, 0.458), 480 attempts each: target 211 (0.440), ideal 226 (0.471), z = -0.97; every returned pair re-checked (0 bad pairs); 3 to 6 attempts per 1000 halted in both conditions. Pass. The observed rates sit below the pure-birthday value by the in-flight and cut losses of section 4, as planned.
Not tested: the full 256-bit functional graph; iterations of length above 2^40; other values of K. Fixed-K first-repeat times from random starts are not independent samples (one functional graph); they were seen
to deviate from the law by 0.70 to 1.65 for n = 16..36 in unrecorded smoke runs and are not evidence either way. A deviation of f from H1 that raises the collision rate only helps; one that lowers it by eps costs the table of section 4.

## 6. Experiment `rho-n22`

The organizer runs the same program at n = 22 (section 5 of the program): DP bits 4, 7 lanes, budgets from `plan(22)`, up to 60 fresh attempts per trial (success amplification is used only by the experiment),
and returns the two messages 0^32 || x, 0^32 || y. The organizer recomputes the 3-round digests and checks that they agree in the low 22 bits and the messages are distinct. This checks the circuit, the trail
bookkeeping, the table, the recovery and the message construction on the real target; it does not measure the cost or the success probability at width 256, and the observation counters are the program's own.

## 7. Memory

Table: 18,432 entries * 32 bytes = 589,824 bytes (key 8, index 8, length 16). Code: at most 10,400 instructions * 36 bytes (opcode, registers and an inline 256-bit immediate) = 374,400 bytes
(main body 9,587, recovery 640, handlers about 170). Counters and ages: below 2,048 bytes. Total 966,272 bytes = 2^19.88 <= 2^20. Claim `memory_log2_bytes` = 20.
